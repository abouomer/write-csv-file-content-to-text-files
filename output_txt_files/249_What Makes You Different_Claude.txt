Here are the key positioning insights from the transcript:

—
**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
"I am not trying to change what is there. I'm trying to change the relationship to what is there. And then once I change the relationship to what is there, we now have the opportunity to more easily investigate transformation."

**Contrasted Against:**  
The common coaching/therapy approach of trying to directly change or fix unwanted thoughts, behaviors or circumstances

**Why It Matters:**  
This approach acknowledges and works with what is, rather than fighting against it, creating more sustainable transformation by first shifting the relationship to the issue

**Level of Contrast:**  
Philosophy

**Positioning Soundbite:**  
"Change the relationship before changing the reality"

?? **Synthesized Insight:**
"Sometimes I am planting seeds, sometimes I am pulling weeds, sometimes I am harvesting fruit. And it's hard to know when I'm sitting across from someone, if I am planting seeds, if I'm pulling weeds, or if I'm harvesting fruits. But all three are valuable in transformation."

**Contrasted Against:**  
The expectation that helping work should always produce immediate, visible results

**Why It Matters:**  
Reframes "unsuccessful" sessions as potentially valuable parts of a longer transformation journey, reducing practitioner anxiety about immediate outcomes

**Level of Contrast:**  
Philosophy/Identity
