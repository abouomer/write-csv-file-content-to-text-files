Here are the key behavioral patterns and implied beliefs I observe from Gene's facilitation:

**Unspoken Belief:**  
?? Synthesized: "Emotional responses are data, not failures"

**Enacted Pattern:**
- Consistently celebrates when clients maintain boundaries despite internal resistance (with Debbie and Anne)
- Reframes "negative" emotional responses as signs of growth/sophistication
- Focuses on progress patterns (frequency/intensity/duration) rather than elimination of responses
- Never shames or pathologizes initial emotional reactions

**Why It Matters:**
This belief creates safety for clients to honestly examine their responses without self-judgment. It shifts the focus from "fixing" emotions to understanding them as information and measuring progress through how we navigate them.

**Practitioner Note:**
Rather than trying to help clients eliminate emotional reactions, focus on:
- Validating the response while celebrating boundary maintenance
- Looking for patterns of progress in recovery time
- Helping clients separate the emotional response from the meaning they make about having it

**Explicit Contrast:**
Challenges common therapeutic focus on "managing" or "controlling" emotions, instead treating them as natural data points in growth.

Would you like me to analyze additional implicit beliefs from the transcript?
