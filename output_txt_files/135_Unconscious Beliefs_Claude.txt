Here are the key unconscious beliefs and reframes I identified from the transcript:

**Hidden Belief #1:**
"I must rescue/help everyone who is struggling, even at my own expense" 

**Surfacing Trigger:**
Student asking about pet-sitting pricing and revealing thought pattern: "Why do I think I have to give them a discount?" and "Pet sitting doesn't take a lot of skill"

**Reframing Response:**
Gene reframes by breaking down the components of value:
"They're hiring you for your experience, your expertise, and your time... Just because there's one animal vs eight, it's not one-eighth of the time and energy."

**Behavioral Impact:**
Pattern of undercharging and discounting services, struggling to set firm pricing boundaries

**Hidden Belief #2:** ?? Synthesized
"Having emotional reactions means I'm not handling things well/professionally"

**Surfacing Trigger:**
Multiple students expressing frustration with their own emotional responses to situations (Debbie with discount requests, Anne with art pricing anxiety)

**Reframing Response:**
Gene: "There's two stories - there's the story that happened and then there's the meaning that we are writing...the fact that you're teasing these meta conversations out shows you're becoming more sophisticated in your transformational process"
