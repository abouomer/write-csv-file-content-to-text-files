Here are the key resistance patterns I identified from the transcript:

**Resistance Theme #1:**
"If I see my reality clearly, it will be unbearable"

**Student Expression:**
"I hate my life so much...because I'm now seeing it through a different lens. I'm not just chubby, I'm fat." - Lisa describing intense distress from having her familiar environment/perspective disrupted

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Familiar environments and routines can act as buffers against painful self-awareness. When those buffers are removed, avoided truths become unavoidable, triggering crisis.

**Energetic Signature:**
Panic, overwhelm, physical illness as defense against unbearable awareness

**Facilitation Opportunity:**
Using tapping to create safety around seeing reality clearly, emphasizing that awareness enables choice rather than mandating immediate action

**Strategic Use Case:**
[Group Facilitation / Teaching Moment]
When students face destabilizing insights or perspective shifts

**Resistance Theme #2:** 
"Family obligations are a burden I'm not allowed to release"

**Student Expression:**
"It's like a fucking burden...this is stuff that's like a family legacy" - Anne discussing inherited family crafts

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Inherited objects become proxies for family relationships and obligations. Releasing objects feels like betraying family bonds/values.

**Energetic Signature:**
Anger, resentment, paralysis, feeling trapped between loyalty and autonomy

**Facilitation Opportunity:**
Distinguishing between honoring family legacy and being crushed by it. Exploring permission to choose relationship to inherited items.

**Strategic Use Case:**

Would you like me to continue analyzing additional resistance patterns from the transcript?
