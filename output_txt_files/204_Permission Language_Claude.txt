Here are the key resistance patterns I identified from the transcript:

**Resistance Theme:** "If I'm not hypervigilant, I'll be hurt again"
**Student Expression:** "...ever since I'm reacting in a weird way, whenever I go to community meetings, I'm trying to make sure there's other people around...after any community meeting, I can't sleep for three nights"
**Psychological Mechanism:** Past trauma creating an overactive threat response system, leading to disproportionate safety behaviors and hypervigilance
**Energetic Signature:** Frozen fear/anxiety, collapse around safety needs
**Facilitation Opportunity:** Using metaphors (like the "10-meter wall for 9cm of water") to help calibrate proportionate responses while honoring valid safety needs
**Strategic Use Case:** [Tapping Script / Group Facilitation]

**Resistance Theme:** "If I'm not perfect in helping others, I'll damage them"
**Student Expression:** "I'm so afraid if I am doing a bad job...she might come to the conclusion tapping won't help"
**Psychological Mechanism:** Perfectionism masking fear of responsibility/impact
**Energetic Signature:** Anxious constraint, over-responsibility
**Facilitation Opportunity:** Normalizing imperfect helping, highlighting how transformation happens through multiple touchpoints
**Strategic Use Case:** [Teaching Moment]

?? Synthesized additional patterns are available if needed, but these seemed like the most emotionally charged and psychologically meaningful resistance loops from the transcript.
