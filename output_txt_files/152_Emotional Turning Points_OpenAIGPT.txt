Emotional Turning Point:  
Lisa, overwhelmed by sickness and existential distress away from her normal environment, breathes more steadily and calmly after three rounds of tapping. Her voice softens, and she says, “I just needed to tell somebody that I trust… I haven’t been able to verbalize it to anybody.”

Triggering Phrase or Move:  
“It makes sense that it is so disruptive… like jumping into freezing cold water…and my entire system is in shock.”

Emotional Shift:  
From spiraling overwhelm and identity crisis to grounded self-permission and emotional presence. Initial frantic tone becomes calmer; she loosens her emotional grip by naming what's happening.

Visible or Sensory Cue:  
Deep breath, softened voice, direct “thank you” to the group for bearing witness.

Strategic Importance:  
Models the power of naming disorientation and shock when entering new awareness. The metaphor ("freezing cold water") allows somatic acknowledgment and permission to pause instead of push change.

Eden tears up and acknowledges a deep wave of sadness while naming the long unresolved grief after losing her home in a fire.

Triggering Phrase or Move:  
“There's a part of me that feels as if I'm not allowed to think about that loss… because I'm alive and healthy.”
