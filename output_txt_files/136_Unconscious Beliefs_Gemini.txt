**Hidden Belief:** If I don't accommodate others (even at my own expense), I’m a bad person/not helpful.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Debbie's immediate internal calculations about how much of a discount to offer her friend's referral, despite feeling manipulated and undermined by the request.  "But what really got me that for the first few moments, there was a part of me and instantly jumped on thinking, how much can I discount my price?"

**Reframing Response:** Gene acknowledges and celebrates Debbie’s ultimate boundary-holding, then guides her through tapping on the feelings of obligation, reframing helping as a conscious choice rather than a compulsory duty with unlimited resources.  "There is a difference between thoughtfully using my giftedness to make a difference, and taking responsibility for other people...I need to be discerning...because I am not an unlimited resource.”

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** Initial impulse to comply with discount request, followed by anger and frustration, internal conflict.

**Hidden Belief:**  If I charge what my work is worth, people won't buy it / I'm being greedy. / I should be grateful for any opportunity to sell. (?? Synthesized)

**Surfacing Trigger:** Anne’s procrastination in submitting her artwork pricing for the exhibition and comparing her prices to others. “I guess I'm feeling a little crazy about pricing... I’m feeling bad that I’m not the kind of person that puts stuff up like this off”

**Reframing Response:** Gene taps with Anne on several reframes: 1) This is a low-friction transaction; 2) She deserves fair compensation; 3) Sales aren't critical for survival; 4) Art is subjectively valued, so there's no "perfect" price; 5)  Pricing competitively is acceptable; 6) Sales don't reflect her worth.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** Procrastination, self-criticism, comparing to others, anxiety around pricing

**Hidden Belief:**  Pet sitting is unskilled labor, therefore I should discount my rate for fewer animals/less work. / My personal life/needs shouldn’t factor into my business decisions. (?? Synthesized)

**Surfacing Trigger:** Maggie questioning her rates for pet sitting one animal vs. multiple, and feeling the need to offer a discount. “Why do I think I have to give them a discount?…Pet sitting doesn’t take a lot of skill…”. Also feeling she can't factor her cat's needs into her pricing.

**Reframing Response:** Gene reframes pet sitting as involving experience, expertise, and *time,* all of which deserve compensation.  He emphasizes the value of her time and the transactional nature of the agreement, encouraging Maggie to factor *all* costs (personal and professional) into her rates.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** Undercharging, undervaluing her services, justifying discounts based on perceived effort rather than overall value and life disruption.
