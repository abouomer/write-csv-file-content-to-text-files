Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – Emotional Resource State Resilience

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Step 1: Acknowledge and Accept the Emotional Challenge  
Gene emphasizes that in some situations, like caring for a loved one with dementia, "it is possible that it is impossible not to be hurt." The frame begins with validating that pain or difficulty is inherent and natural.

Step 2: Reframe the Desired Outcome to Reduce Internal Pressure  
Rather than expecting perfection or painlessness, Gene encourages aiming for “the easiest, kindest, and healthiest process possible.”

Step 3: Prepare for the Known and Unknown  
Anticipate both known variables (e.g., old wounds) and unknown ones ("I know they're in the background somewhere... and some that are completely unknown").

Step 4: Identify and Prioritize the Resource State  
It's crucial to “constantly return to managing my resource state,” because "when I am diminished... I lose access to my tools, my creativity, my understanding, my heart."

Step 5: Pre-plan Resource State Support Actions  
Gene recommends pre-identifying low-friction, resource-replenishing behaviors (e.g., “take three deep breaths,” “go for a short walk”) when well-resourced, so they’re available as defaults during stress.

Step 6: Permit Micro-Recovery Before, During, and After  
Empower individuals to "excuse myself and rebuild my resource state" anytime: before, during, or after engagement.

Step 7: Ground in Strength and Adaptive Courage  
Tap into past evidence of resilience—“there are going to be magical ways I do an awesome job”—to affirm capability, even in the face of “choosing between two suboptimal things.”

Supporting Quote:
"I give myself permission... to make my resource state, and protecting my resource state, and refilling my resource state as priorities... because the more well-resourced I am, the easier access I have to every resource I have at my disposal."

Commentary:
This framework was not presented as a labeled tool, but arises consistently during Gene’s coaching and tapping across multiple segments in this Office Hours. It emphasizes acceptance, preparation for unpredictability, and careful self-regulation of one’s emotional energy. Its strength lies in both proactive planning (e.g., setting reminders and menus) and real-time permission for self-care.

Use case:  
Can be used across professional caregiving, client-facing work, family conflict, or personal emotional labor. Strong candidate for naming (e.g., “Resource State Before Strategy”).

Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – Pricing and Boundaries Framework

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Step 1: Recognize the Hidden Costs of the Work  
Gene consistently names that the value provided includes emotional labor, opportunity cost, time, and disruption—not just the direct service rendered.

Step 2: Remove Guilt from Setting Boundaries  
Just because a need exists ("someone is suffering") does not mean one is obligated to respond at personal cost. “They are not more important than me.”

Step 3: Establish a Clear Baseline Offer  
Create an internal pricing framework. What is your minimum cost to engage in this service or disruption (e.g., staying at someone’s house, pet-sitting)?

Step 4: Assign Add-ons Thoughtfully  
Instead of discounting for less labor (e.g., fewer pets), view additional requests as layered surcharges (e.g., travel, medications, additional pets).

Step 5: Communicate Confidently and Cleanly  
When clarification is needed (e.g., client is vague), declare what you understand the terms to be, then make room for correction: “This is what I’m assuming—please respond by X. If I don’t hear back, I’ll proceed as if this is accurate.”

Step 6: Separate Self-Worth from Pricing  
Art pricing, freelancing, and legacy business relationships can cause emotional confusion. Remind yourself: “whether or not someone buys is not a statement on who I am or the value of my work.”

Step 7: Pre-Set Emotional Protection Protocols  
Build pricing and boundaries when resourced, so you don’t have to rethink them every time under emotional pressure.

Supporting Quote:
“I want to make every decision I can when I’m well resourced, so that when I’m in a diminished resource state, I already have the menu ready.”

Commentary:
Gene weaves this structure across multiple consults—on pet-sitting, pricing photo art, and business contracts with unclear clients. Together, these outline a trackable and teachable pricing/boundary checklist. Particularly resonant when helpers, artists, or service providers undervalue their time or sabotage rates due to guilt or lack of clarity.

Works well as a boundary-setting and monetization framework with potential naming like “Base + Add-On Model” or “Value Before Guilt.”

Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – Responder Collapse Spiral

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Step 1: Identify the Trigger  
Something happens (e.g., someone asks for a discount or criticizes your emotional reaction). From there emerges an inner voice saying, “Why am I reacting this way? I should be over this by now.”

Step 2: Label the Meta-Reaction  
Most distress isn’t about the request or pricing—it’s meta-level shame about having emotions or struggling. “I’m mad at myself for wanting to discount.”

Step 3: Interrupt Spiraling Self-Blame  
Introduce a statement like: “I responded like a human being… and that emotional part didn’t win.” Honors growth when things feel hard but are managed.

Step 4: Use Frequency, Intensity, and Duration as Success Metrics  
Instead of asking “why do I still feel this way?” ask “Is it shorter, less intense, or less frequent than before?”

Step 5: Normalize and Celebrate Micro-Wins  
Keep perspective: protect your self-trust by celebrating you held the line, even if it was hard. Growth isn’t feeling perfect—it’s acting wisely under duress.

Supporting Quote:
“Yes, the emotion came up… but you didn’t stay stuck… You held the line.”

Commentary:
This lens on “emotional self-judgment” is threaded into Gene’s coaching with both Debbie and Anne. Particularly relevant for long-time helpers, practitioners, and people deeply engaged in self-growth. It helps shift emotional disappointment from fatal flaw to evidence of transformation.

Could benefit from a label like “Clean Growth Metrics” or “Responding to the Responder.”

Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – Decision-Making Under Diminished Resource State

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Step 1: Acknowledge You Are in a Diminished State  
Stress, illness, travel, or grief limits your capacity. Admit it: don’t expect top-level decision-making.

Step 2: Reduce Cognitive Load Preemptively  
Prepare resource menus or heuristic defaults while resourced—three things to do when stressed, reminders hidden in your phone.

Step 3: Frame Goals in “Better not Perfect” Language  
Set realistic expectations: “frictionless… doesn’t mean frictionless,” “as healthy as possible… doesn’t mean painless.”

Step 4: Time Decisions Accordingly  
When resourced—make strategic decisions. When diminished—use menus, do triage, ask for help.

Step 5: Normalize Feeling Off-Track  
Being off doesn’t mean you’ve regressed. It means you’re aware.

Supporting Quote:
“The question is: how do I respond when I’ve had a crappy emotional response—and how quickly do I leave the emotional state?”

Commentary:
Embedded throughout Gene’s persistent encouragement to pre-write menus, reduce decisions under stress, and plan from a wise place. Framework could be formalized as “Responsive Self-Design,” “Stress Smart Defaults,” or “DIY Resource State Protocol.”

Framework Name: Unnamed Framework

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

Step 1: Make Disempowered Conversations Empowering  
If a stakeholder won’t respond to questions or options, convert soft asks to statements like “I understand X is the request. Let me know if that’s incorrect.”

Step 2: Document Accountability Trail  
Doing so means when the project misses expectations, you can factually reference the documentation showing their input (or lack thereof).

Step 3: Move From “Clarify” to “Lead”  
When collaboration stalls, “the one who shows up with the plan gets their way.” Be the one who proposes not just options, but a clear, viable, timeline-bound plan.

Step 4: Include Scope + Contingency  
When crafting deliverables, add transparent cost ranges with justifications for overruns when variables lie beyond your control.

Supporting Quote:
“Oftentimes the person who shows up with the plan gets their way... rather than getting caught in the quagmire of decisions.”

Commentary:
This framework lives in Gene’s coaching to student 2 managing a vague assignment with an uncommunicative superior. While simple, it’s potent for freelancers, adjuncts, and contract workers.
