Here are the key teaching/facilitation patterns I identified from Gene's office hours session:

**Process Pattern Name:** "Emotional Granularity Loop"
**Sequence Overview:**
- Phase 1: Notice & Name the global emotional response
- Phase 2: Identify specific physical/emotional components
- Phase 3: Question the specifics for deeper understanding
- Phase 4: Tap while narrating insights 
- Phase 5: Check shifts and repeat if needed

**Commentary:**
Gene consistently uses this pattern to help clients move from overwhelm to clarity. He guides them to break down big emotional experiences into more manageable pieces. Shows up multiple times, especially with Linda's "two minds" work and Anne's family heirlooms processing.

**Process Pattern Name:** "?? Synthesized - Course-to-Fine Tuning Arc"
**Sequence Overview:**

- Phase 3: Notice natural entry points for details
- Phase 4: Toggle between macro and micro as needed

**Commentary:**
Reconstructed from Gene's work with multiple clients dealing with overwhelming situations. He explicitly discusses this pattern near the end. Allows clients to productively engage with complex issues without getting stuck in details too early.
