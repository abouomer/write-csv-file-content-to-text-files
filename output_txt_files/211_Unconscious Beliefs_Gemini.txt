**Hidden Belief:**  
If I leave my routine, I will get sick/die.

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Lisa's description of her sudden illness after leaving home for the first time in years: *"I live at home. I take care of my mom. I haven't been outta my house...in years...I'm staying at somebody else's house. I'm deathly ill...I haven't not slept in my own bed every night for like the last 10 years."*

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene uses tapping and reframing language to help Lisa see her illness as a shock response to a new environment, allowing her to be gentle with herself and observe her reactions without judgment: *"I'm in a new environment...I'm getting the opportunity to see things from a different angle...It makes sense that it is so disruptive and it is so unmooring...I just give myself permission to be gentle with myself...because this is like jumping into freezing cold water."*

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**
Extreme anxiety and fear of dying after leaving her routine.

**Hidden Belief:**  
Anxiety about falling is making me more likely to fall.

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Laurel's description of her obsessive thoughts about falling: *"Every time I get out of our pickup truck, I envision myself falling out of it. Every time I get out of the tub, I envision myself falling over the edge."*

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene helps Laurel realize that her anxiousness and tension increase her risk of falling, and through tapping, guides her to visualize safe movements: *"It didn't occur to me that all my anxiousness about falling is making me that much more tense and likely to fall...because of the fear right now, I'm actually more likely to fall because I'm really tense."*

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**
Obsessive, intrusive thoughts and physical tension.

**Hidden Belief:**  
Because I lost my home, I’m afraid of losing everything I love. I’m not allowed to be happy because I should be grateful I survived.

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Eden's fear of car accidents, stemming from past trauma of house fire, then jumping to fears about her current house and dog.  *"Something unlikely happened to me...I’m so afraid of getting in a car accident...I just feel like I’m gonna lose it [her new home]...her health [dog's] has been so up and down...like she could go at any moment."*

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene connects Eden's seemingly disparate fears by identifying the common tag of "valuable things," acknowledges her grief, and reframes the idea that she can't appreciate her current life while still grieving past loss: *"It makes sense that there is a part of me that wants me to be safe...but this part of me has mistaken the possible for the probable...I’m lucky to be alive. But just because that is true, it does not mean I’m not allowed to engage with the grief…It's safe for me to engage with the sadness even though I am alive."*

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**
Hypervigilance, fear, sadness, anxiety about losing loved ones and possessions.

**Hidden Belief:** If I don’t care about things, losing them won’t hurt me. If I don’t care, I don’t have to worry.

**Surfacing Trigger:**
Brad's realization during Eden's share that he has a lifetime of unaddressed loss and grief, leading to apathy and lack of motivation to deal with his physical environment. *"If I don’t care about it, losing it won’t hurt me…If I don’t think about it, if I don’t care about it, then I just don’t have to worry."*

**Reframing Response:**
Gene encourages Brad to explore his feelings about his space, the transition to a smaller house, and the piles of belongings, emphasizing noticing without judgment and the recursive nature of processing grief. Gene also encourages Brad to treat this exploration as a research project with a specific length of time.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**
Lack of motivation, feeling of waiting to die, cluttered environment.

**Hidden Belief:**  I must be in control to feel safe. Being of two minds means being out of control, and that’s unsafe.

**Surfacing Trigger:**
Linda’s relaxation upon hearing the phrase “two minds” and subsequent realization that she doesn't feel safe or allowed to hold conflicting emotions. *"Every time you say that, part of me relaxes…I realize I don’t feel safe and I don’t feel I’m allowed to have…be of two minds."*

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene uses tapping to address Linda's discomfort with being of two minds, reframing it as a healthy and multi-dimensional response, separate from the need to make decisions and take action: *"I give myself permission to have a multidimensional emotional response to a situation…I am allowed to make thoughtful decisions that I stand by, and I’m allowed to be of two minds."*

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**
Discomfort, feeling of no control, world falling apart, lack of order.

**Hidden Belief:** I can’t get rid of family heirlooms because they are part of my family history and I’d be disrespecting my family.  (??Synthesized)
Keeping these items is a burden, reflecting anger at family obligations.

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Anne's struggle with inherited baskets and quilts, feeling the weight of them and family expectations, yet wanting to get rid of them.  Anger surfaces connected to family burdens: *"I have...baskets that my parents made...I got all these inherited quilts...They all really weigh on me...it’s like a fucking burden."*

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene helps Anne deconstruct the monolithic view of these items, suggesting she assess her emotional connection to each individual piece. He also highlights the underlying value she places on family and creation, validating her feelings but encouraging her to consider her own relationship to these objects and her family history, including potential family burdens/anger.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**
Feeling overwhelmed, frozen, tightness in chest.
