Metaphor:  
"It’s kind of like only looking at the front of something for a long time... and then spinning it in three dimension."

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
This metaphor explains how entering a new context (a house-sitting trip) disrupts one’s sense of safety and identity — not due to any danger, but because it suddenly reveals new angles of the self and life. The lived reality has always had depth, but changing environments causes a literal and symbolic “rotation,” exposing unseen dimensions of dissatisfaction, grief, and insight. It helps the student understand why emotional disruption may spike when external change occurs: identity blind spots are being illuminated.

Stickiness Factor:  
The visual of spinning an object in 3D is cognitively grounding. It’s familiar (turning an object to inspect it) yet metaphorically revealing. It surprises in its elegance — not a breakdown, but a dimensional revelation.

Transformation Type:  
Process / Identity Shift

Delivery Context:  
Used spontaneously during Lisa's first tap-in around emotional flooding from leaving her home of 10 years for the first time.

Metaphor:  
"This is like jumping into freezing cold water, and my entire system is in shock."

What It Illustrates:  
The shock and overwhelm of sudden change — especially emotional exposure after a long interior freeze. Lisa’s moment of clarity away from home cracks open years of suppressed grief, body shaming, and identity dislocation. The metaphor explains that intense dysregulation signals not danger, but adaptation — a nervous system being un-numbed by temperature change.

Stickiness Factor:  
It's visceral. Almost everyone has had the sensation of cold shock — it’s involuntary, full-body, stunning. It biologically maps to trauma awakening, making the emotional explanation land deeply.

Transformation Type:  
Problem / Nervous System Process / Safety Calibration

Delivery Context:  
Spontaneous metaphor while co-regulating with Lisa in Session 1 tapping round.

Metaphor:  
"Because of the fear right now, I am actually more likely to fall. Because I'm really tense — and it's hard to move in a healthy way when I'm really tense."

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
This metaphor reverses the assumption of safety as hypervigilance. It teaches that fear-based muscular bracing (emotional or physical) actually undermines the intended outcome. Anxiety, meant to keep us upright, ironically makes us stumble. It reframes the role of tension in accidents — and expands to all places where we brace against loss or catastrophe.

Stickiness Factor:  
Counterintuitive logic lands hard here — fear causing danger rather than preventing it. Anchors to physiology (tight muscles reducing coordination), but maps onto emotional states universally.

Transformation Type:  
Reframe / Outcome Clarifier / Belief Shift

Delivery Context:  
In Laurel’s tapping session about constant fear of falling — bathtub, truck, stairs.

Metaphor:  
"I have not fallen before — I hold onto the handrail and I’m fine."

"What do you feel when you imagine that?"
"I feel pretty secure… I'm not questioning anything — I'm just walking down the steps."

What It Illustrates:  
While not a vivid metaphor, this conversational turn illustrates the shift from imagined catastrophe to embodied memory of safety. Laurel shifts her future simulations from fear-prone visuals to grounded, sensory-rich experience. It’s seed-stage imagery for reprogramming the subconscious prediction engine.

Stickiness Factor:  
This dialog disarms fear with realism, not fantasy. The shift from “spooky movie” to “home video” normalizes ease.

Transformation Type:  
Process / Outcome

Delivery Context:  
Result of progressive tapping reframes. Part of memory-based consolidation of safety into the mental imagery.

Metaphor:  
"There’s always two stories going on: the facts as we understand them — and the meaning we assign to those facts."

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
Gene conveys the dual-channel nature of cognition: the sensory/truth layer vs. the interpretive/emotional meaning-making layer. It's a foundation for understanding why tapping works — it allows us to keep the facts intact while updating the meaning to support healing. This metaphor explains Emotional Truth as a separable, updateable file.

Stickiness Factor:  
Elegant structure. "Two stories" anchors multiplicity — clear for analyzing trauma narratives vs. logistical reality.

Transformation Type:  
Foundational Teaching / Identity Truth / Cognitive Reframe

Delivery Context:  
Explaining to Eden and audience why tapping shifts imagery (car, house, needle fear) without denying facts.

Metaphor:  
“They aren't just things — they’re tagged. Like metadata. Like inside of an Apple Notes file. It’s not a bucket — it’s a cluster of tagged identity objects.”

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
Explains grief clustering — why emotionally significant objects trigger each other even across categories (dog, house, furniture). The metaphor compares the subconscious to a database that organizes meaning by tags, not logic trees. When a tag like “love,” “safety,” or “lost too soon” gets pinged, anything with that tag lights up at once.

Stickiness Factor:  
Modern, digital-native visual. Refactors the emotional brain’s “folders” into a smart-tag system. Modular and scalable metaphor, very sticky for tech-savvy students.

Transformation Type:  
Process / Emotional Logic

Delivery Context:  
Used to explain to Eden why fears of house, dog, fire, driving all trigger in parallel after trauma.

Metaphor:  
“It’s not a constellation of emotions — it’s an entire sky full of constellations.”

What It Illustrates:  
Vividly expresses the overwhelming multiplicity of emotional content (loss, obligation, anger, identity, family legacy) when engaging with inherited objects. Rather than finding the ‘one’ thread, Ann is navigating a whole star map of entanglements. This gives permission to slow down and orient.

Stickiness Factor:  
Shocking expansion. A single poetic switch turns overwhelm into cosmic scale. Beautiful image for teaching stacked trauma or grief processing.

Transformation Type:  
Problem / Emotional Truth

Delivery Context:  
Spontaneous metaphor while helping Ann tap through overwhelm when trying to declutter family quilts and baskets.

Metaphor:  
“This isn’t just one tangled necklace — it’s a giant ball of tangled necklaces.”

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
When beliefs, emotional inheritance, epigenetic material, objects, and roles intersect, the work is fractal. This metaphor expresses the multi-threaded nature of identity-level grief and legacy processing. It also justifies the recursive nature of healing — sometimes you untangle for space, not for clarity.

Stickiness Factor:  
Unclutter metaphors are already sticky. Elevating from “one tangled necklace” to a Lego-sized ball of them adds novelty. Visual and tactile — lands instantly.

Transformation Type:  
Process / Problem / Emotional Truth

Delivery Context:  
Used repeatedly across student shares (Brad, Sue, Ann) re: possessions, emotional burden, family inheritance, overwhelm.

Metaphor:  
“Collective nouns are useful — until we treat them as a single object. We talk about ‘the baskets’ — but we’re emotionally reacting as if they’re one thing.”

What It Illustrates:  
Gene demonstrates how grammar reflects — and distorts — emotional logic. We subconsciously self-trick by naming many things with one phrase, making decision-making heavier. This metaphor helps a person zoom out. It invites distinction within "the basket problem" and unlocks incremental progress.

Stickiness Factor:  
Cognitive metaphor around language — precise, novel, and flips a common problem elegantly. It's self-repeating once learned.

Transformation Type:  
Belief Shift / Cognitive Reframe

Delivery Context:  
In Ann’s deep tapping session about burden of inherited handmade objects.

Metaphor:  
“When we revisit some of these emotions, we don’t dive in — we course tune. We step back 70,000 feet like a satellite before fine-tuning one strand.”

What It Illustrates:  
Gene teaches zoom-level work in trauma healing. Sometimes we go close-in to clear belief detail (“fine tune”), but at emotional overwhelm or contradiction, it’s healthier to course tune — see the whole field without making decisions yet. This grants permission to pause without judgment.

Stickiness Factor:  
Blends tech + spiritual language. Courses and therapy rooms alike can repurpose “course tuning” vs “fine-tuning.” Feels technical but grounded.

Transformation Type:  
Process Meta-Frame / Coaching Strategy

Delivery Context:  
Taught during discussion with Ann after she uncovered intertwined themes of anger, grief, obligation, and legacy.
