Based on the transcript, here are some key teaching meta-patterns I observed in Gene's facilitation:

**Meta-Pattern Name: Resource State Loop**

**Patterned Behavior:**
Gene consistently brings attention back to the client's resource state, both directly and indirectly. He acknowledges emotional challenges while reinforcing the importance of maintaining and rebuilding energy/capacity. This shows up repeatedly in phrases like "when I am diminished..." and "check your resource state."

**Structural Form:**
Spiral pattern - Each loop acknowledges the current state while pointing toward resource maintenance, creating an upward spiral of awareness and capability.

**Teaching Impact:**
- Helps clients develop sustainable self-regulation habits
- Reduces shame around emotional responses
- Builds metacognitive awareness of energy/capacity

**Reuse Strategy:**
- Check-in points during longer workshops
- Client self-assessment tools
- Program design that includes explicit resource state maintenance

**Meta-Pattern Name: "Even Though" Sandwich**

**Patterned Behavior:**
Gene frequently validates current challenges while simultaneously pointing to capability/possibility. Structure: "Even though [challenge], you still [capability/success]." Example: "Even though you had that emotional response, you still made the right choice."

**Structural Form:**
Sandwich pattern - Challenge acknowledgment -> Bridge -> Capability reminder

**Teaching Impact:**
- Reduces resistance to change
- Maintains emotional safety while stretching
- Builds confidence through balanced perspective

**Reuse Strategy:**
- Written feedback
- Course material framing
- 1:1 coaching conversations

**Tags:**
- Insight Density: 7/10
- Confidence Score: 8/10
