Hidden Belief:  
If I harden to protect myself from toxic people, it means I'm becoming less human and losing my compassion.

Surfacing Trigger:  
Student said: "I'm afraid that if I really harden, I become less human and less sensitive." This was shared when describing the impulse to either fully enmesh or cut ties with a compulsively lying relative.

?? Synthesized

Reframing Response:  
Gene gently questioned the binary thinking by asking: “Why is the necessary opposite of compassion hardening?” and guided the student to explore a spectrum between openness and emotionally porous enmeshment. He helped her reimagine compassion as a recognition of someone’s humanity without inviting them fully into her emotional world: “What might it look like for you to appreciate the humanity of the other person... without enmeshing yourself with them?”

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
This belief likely caused repeated emotional burnout, porous boundaries with toxic relatives, and feelings of failure for not feeling “enough” compassion. The student expressed that every encounter pierces her boundaries "like butter," suggesting chronic over-empathy.

Hidden Belief:  
If I create boundaries with my close family, I will have to leave the relationships entirely.

Surfacing Trigger:  
Student said: “If I created a boundary, then... I'd have to leave... it's like I have to stay in an unhealthy way because the healthiest way would be to leave.” This emerged when discussing why she can set boundaries with clients but not family.

?? Synthesized

Reframing Response:  
Gene reflected the subconscious binary by stating: “There's a part of me that believes this is an all or nothing proposition.” He used tapping to loosen the belief: “I'm either fully engaged or I'm fully disconnected... and that might be true, and it might not be true.” He followed with reframing through possibilities and encouraged exploring middle-ground responses with family.

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
This belief reinforces a defensive pattern of emotionally overextending or shutting down, paralyzing the student from creating minor, progressive shifts in toxic relationships.

Hidden Belief:  
If I say or do something wrong in a session, the client might write off tapping entirely—and that would be my fault.

Surfacing Trigger:  
Student said: “I'm so afraid if I do a bad job, she might come to the conclusion tapping won't help... and that's because I made a bad job.” This arose while discussing a potentially overwhelming client case.

Reframing Response:  
Gene joked gently: "I appreciate the fact that you understand your unwavering power of persuasion over other people..." to highlight the distortions of responsibility. He then normalized the idea of being one step on someone’s journey: “Sometimes we are planting seeds, sometimes pulling weeds, sometimes harvesting fruit.” He emphasized that even unsuccessful sessions can lay useful groundwork for future help.

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
Perfectionism, fear of unworthiness, over-responsibility, hesitation to take client work, possibly impeding growth as a practitioner.

Hidden Belief:  
If I don’t go all-in on safety, I won’t be safe.

Surfacing Trigger:  
Student shared exaggerated hypervigilance after an aggressive encounter: “After any community meeting, I can't sleep for three nights.” Later used Gene’s metaphor: “it's like building a 10-meter wall for nine centimeters of water.”

Reframing Response:  
Gene introduced the image of scalable protection: “There is something between not paying attention at all, and over-functioning.” Through tapping, he helped uncouple the idea that a smaller protective stance necessarily equates to recklessness: “It is possible for me to be guarded and safe without being constantly vigilant.”

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
Triggered hypervigilance, disrupted sleep, unbalanced nervous-system responses to re-engagement with community.

Hidden Belief:  
If I act out of frustration or anger, it means I’ve failed morally—it disqualifies me from being good.

Surfacing Trigger:  
After acknowledging calling someone an “idiot,” the student said, “I don't usually do that... I don't like where I went with this.”

Reframing Response:  
Gene gently normalized this regression as a sign that something needed more attention: “It pointed to something taking up way more real estate in your heart, mind, and soul than you wanted.” He reframed a temporary misbehavior as distinct from failure of identity: “There's a difference between failing in the moment and being a failure. One is an action, the other is a state.”

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
Shame spiral, self-judgment, moral over-policing, preventative guilt before risk-taking in interpersonal action.
