**Resistance Theme:**  Downplaying the value of her time and services, feeling the need to offer discounts even when the core service remains the same.

**Student Expression:** "Why don't I just throw out what I charge the other people? Like, why do I think I have to give them a discount?"  (Said with frustration and confusion) Also mentions feeling that pet-sitting "doesn't take a lot of skill" despite acknowledging the trust the clients have in her.

**Psychological Mechanism:**  Undervaluing her skills and time, possibly rooted in societal devaluation of caregiving professions.  Fear of appearing greedy or unaccommodating. Tendency to personalize business transactions and make them about her personal circumstances (e.g., her cat's needs).

**Energetic Signature:** Uncertainty, self-doubt, minimizing her own needs, confusion.

**Facilitation Opportunity:** Tapping on the belief that she needs to offer discounts and the underlying fear of charging what she's worth.  Reframing the value of her service as encompassing not just the direct pet care, but also the peace of mind and trust she provides.  Encouraging her to create a pricing framework based on her overall time and life disruption.

?? **Synthesized Resistance Theme:** Discomfort with emotional responses, self-judgment for having "negative" emotions, desire to control or suppress feelings rather than process them.

**Student Expression:**  Debbie: "What really got me that for the first few moments, there was a part of me and instantly jumped on thinking, how much can I discount my price? Right? And that is the like, okay, let's bring it in if there is a chance." Anne: "This is not like me at all... to do something at the last minute. And I'm trying to kind of figure...I'm feeling bad that I am not the kind of person that, that puts stuff up like this off.”

**Psychological Mechanism:** Internalized belief that certain emotions are "bad" or "wrong."  Fear of being judged for having these emotions.  Attempting to control emotional responses rather than allowing them to be present and processed.  This can lead to secondary layers of resistance around the initial trigger.

**Energetic Signature:**  Buzzing discomfort, self-criticism, frustration with self, attempting to suppress or control emotions.

**Facilitation Opportunity:** Tapping on the judgment around the emotional responses.  Normalizing the experience of having a range of emotions, including "negative" ones.  Exploring the information that emotions can provide and practicing self-compassion.  Introducing the concept of emotional spins and how to unravel them rather than getting stuck.
