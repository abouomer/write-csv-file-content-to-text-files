Here are the key positioning insights from Gene's session:

—
**Unique Positioning Insight:**
"I want to be in a circumstance where the people in my life maintain my boundaries for me... Until we get to that point, we need to maintain our boundaries ourselves. We go from: 'I don't have the emotional fortitude to maintain boundaries' to 'I have the fortitude but it costs me a lot' to 'I have the fortitude and it doesn't cost much' to finally having others protect our boundaries."

**Contrasted Against:**
The common coaching approach of "just set and maintain boundaries" without acknowledging the evolutionary journey or emotional cost

**Why It Matters:**  
Validates the struggle while showing a clear developmental path that honors both current reality and aspirational goals

**Level of Contrast:**
Philosophy / Emotional Posture

**Positioning Soundbite:**
"From maintaining boundaries to having them maintained"

**Unique Positioning Insight:**
"When I am pricing for my time, I am not pricing for the time I'm spending with a person - I am pricing for everything involved in that fulfillment, including client acquisition. The money I make from the time I spend has to cover all of that time as well."

**Contrasted Against:**
Common pricing approach of only charging for direct service delivery time

**Why It Matters:**
Reframes pricing from hourly mindset to value-based business model that accounts for total costs

**Level of Contrast:**
Philosophy / Business Model

**Positioning Soundbite:**
"Price for the whole ecosystem, not just the moment"

?? **Synthesized Insight:**
Gene consistently positions transformation as a gradual evolution rather than a binary shift - whether with boundaries, pricing confidence, or emotional responses. He validates current struggles while painting a clear picture of development stages.

**Contrasted Against:**
Traditional coaching's "just do it" or "push through" mentality

**Why It Matters:**
Creates safety and permission for the messy middle while maintaining forward momentum
