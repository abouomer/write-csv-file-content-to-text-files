Process Pattern Name:  
?? Synthesized – “Emotional Unwinding via Specific Reframing”

Sequence Overview:
- Phase 1: Name and Witness the Emotional Storm
- Phase 2: Localize and Personify the Sensation
- Phase 3: Introduce Safety, Permission & Dual Awareness
- Phase 4: Restate Reality with Counter-Evidence
- Phase 5: Ground in New Insight Through Visualization or Context Recheck

Commentary:  
Across multiple interactions, Gene consistently uses a core arc that hinges on helping clients gently dismantle emotionally overwhelming states by combining somatic tuning with language permission and resourcing. Sessions with Lisa, Laurel, and Eden follow almost identical structures:

- An initial emotional overwhelm is voiced (sometimes with shame or confusion).
- Gene guides them into locating the emotion somatically (solar plexus, chest, collarbone, etc).
- That physical sensation is engaged directly as a character or voice (“ask the butterflies what they’re afraid of…”).
- Permission language structures are layered in to normalize the reactivity (“It makes sense that ____”).
- Overarching cognitive distortions (dramatic expectations of catastrophe, shame over dual feelings, etc.) are gently reframed by introducing counter-examples or actual lived data (“you’ve gotten out of the tub many times safely”), allowing the body to feel safer.
- A looping return to the original stimulus is used like a “before-and-after” field test to confirm that emotional charge has softened.

While the general EFT algorithm is present, Gene’s innovation is the sequencing: centering safety and multidimensionality first (dual minds, opposite feelings, permission to not know), followed by evidence-based updates that feel “non-coercive.”

This pattern shows up in sessions about trauma (home loss), anticipatory anxiety (fear of falling), and overwhelm (family artifacts and legacy). Because of this recyclability across content areas, it presents as an extremely reusable framework in onboarding sequences, emotional safety containers, or high-stakes 1:1 work.

?? Synthesized from:
- Lisa’s home-sickness / identity unraveling
- Laurel’s rehearsed falling catastrophe phobia
- Eden’s post-traumatic fire anxiety / over-vigilance
- Anne’s legacy storage burden grief
- Brad’s accumulation-based identity grief
- Sue’s resistance to letting go of possessions

Process Pattern Name:  
?? Synthesized – “Disentangle the Emotional Hairball”

Sequence Overview:
- Phase 1: Let the tangle be overwhelming (no forced clarity)
- Phase 2: Coarse-scan themes to reveal layered patterns (e.g. grief + guilt + obligation)
- Phase 3: Identify “tags” or emotional metadata (e.g. “objects related to shame”)
- Phase 4: Gather signs and data across time without solving (field research tapping)
- Phase 5: Use “maybe piles” or soft sorting language to initiate forward movement
- Phase 6: Return for deeper fine-tuning once emotion stabilizes

Commentary:  
Gene uses this unstated but consistent approach to deal with emotional complexity when participants encounter entrenched overwhelm — particularly patterns like multi-generational grief, inherited family legacy, or endurance trauma. Gene discourages immediate hyper-resolution and instead names (or personifies) the pile: “it’s not just one problem; it’s an emotionally tangled hairball.”

The hairball model reappears in:
- Storage overwhelm (Anne’s inherited baskets; Brad’s boxes of dreams)
- Existential drift (“I’m just waiting to die”)
- Fire loss trauma overlaid with pet stress and home precariousness (Eden)
- Sue’s resistance to clutter clearing when parts of self are bound to objects

The genius of this model is its permission to scan — to research before solving. Tight cognition or hyperfixated processing is paused, in favor of “coarse tuning” (as Gene contrasts with “fine tuning”). This process creates meaningful progress around emotionally enmeshed topics without short-circuiting the body’s need to feel safe.

This is extremely portable for use in:
- Mid-stage grief processing
- Onboarding students with unresolved identity shifts
- Clients facing “stuff accumulation” or space entropy (often masking deeper losses)

?? Synthesized from Gene’s language across multiple clients:
- Anne (basket & quilt overwhelm via family guilt)
- Brad (identity dissolution, loss layering)
- Eden (fear of losing multiple valuable things at once)
- Sue (stagnant piles + rebellion against control narratives)

Process Pattern Name:  
Self-Reframe via Imagined Advice (aka “Self-Coaching Model”)

Sequence Overview:
- Phase 1: Name fear pattern clearly (e.g., fear of falling)
- Phase 2: Think of a friend with this problem
- Phase 3: State aloud what you’d tell them
- Phase 4: Feel that reframed logic land somatically
- Phase 5: Anchor in new behavior possibility

Commentary:  
Gene briefly—but tactically—recaps a model he’s built more fully elsewhere: improving emotional flexibility via externalized coaching. The heart of this trick is disassociation from a shame spiral by offering advice to a fictional “other.” In Eden and Laurel’s sessions, subtle changes in visualization and physical readiness appear once this distance is created.

Process Pattern Name:  
Binary Collapse for Internal Permission

Sequence Overview:
- Phase 1: Spot the polarized belief (control vs. chaos, emotion vs. gratitude)
- Phase 2: Give both poles space to be valid
- Phase 3: Apply permission phrases to “undo” the either/or logic
- Phase 4: Rebuild security without control (safe in self, not circumstance)
- Phase 5: Watch dual awareness settle the nervous system

Commentary:  
Gene uses this pattern with Linda, Eden, and Anne — all of whom carry deep dual reactions around love or control. A grief-layered mind says, “if I grieve, I’m not grateful,” or “if I’m not in control, I’m not safe.” In this arc, Gene ventures to normalize the paradox as human. Giving space for “two minds” is emotional liberation in action. This model opens people to new movement when otherwise gridlocked.
