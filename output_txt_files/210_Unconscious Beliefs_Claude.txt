Let me analyze the transcript for unconscious beliefs that Gene surfaced and reframed:

—
**Hidden Belief:**  
"If I let go of physical objects, I lose part of myself/my identity"

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Sue's resistance to clearing larger piles: "That I have to let go of something...it's like part of me"

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene reframed the all-or-nothing thinking about possessions: "I give myself permission to know that that is not the case, and it is okay for me to be discerning on an individual level."

**Behavioral Impact:**  
Paralysis and resistance to organizing/decluttering larger spaces, while able to handle small areas

**Strategic Reuse:**  
Where to use: Coaching Tool for decluttering resistance, Tapping Script for attachment to possessions

?? **Synthesized Hidden Belief:**
"Having control equals safety; lack of control equals danger"

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Multiple clients showing fear around uncertainty and change. Linda specifically noted: "Oh, what a core belief it is of mine that I need to have control...that I'm not safe if things fall apart"

**Reframing Response:**
Gene helped reframe that safety comes from internal resources rather than external control: "I can be safe and not in control as long as I'm safe inside of me"

**Behavioral Impact:**
Difficulty being "of two minds" or holding multiple perspectives, need for decisive clarity

**Strategic Reuse:**
Where to use: Core Module on Safety/Control, Resistance Map for change work
