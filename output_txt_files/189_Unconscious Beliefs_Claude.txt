Based on the transcript, here are key unconscious beliefs that Gene surfaced:

—
**Hidden Belief:**
"If I'm not fully emotionally open/vulnerable with family members, I'm cutting them off completely" (from Debbie's case)

**Surfacing Trigger:**
Student expressing that she feels she must either be completely emotionally open or completely closed off with difficult family members, saying "I only feel like I'm able to do the extremes"

**Reframing Response:**
Gene reframed this as a spectrum rather than binary choice: "What does that look like if that's a spectrum instead of a switch that we're flipping back and forth?" He helped surface that this was a subconscious belief rather than reality.

**Behavioral Impact:**
Student was allowing toxic family members past all boundaries because she believed maintaining any boundaries meant complete disconnection.
