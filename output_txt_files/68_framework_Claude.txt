Let me analyze this transcript for frameworks and teaching models:

—
**Framework Name:**  
"Well-Informed Proportionate Response Model"

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
- Step 1: Acknowledge the legitimacy of the initial emotional response
- Step 2: Recognize current response patterns and their intensity
- Step 3: Assess if the response level matches the actual threat/situation
- Step 4: Identify middle-ground responses between complete disengagement and overreaction
- Step 5: Give permission to adjust response levels while maintaining appropriate boundaries

**Supporting Quote:**  
"The goal is never not to have emotion. The goal is a proportionate, well-informed emotional response."

**Commentary:**  
This framework was synthesized from Gene's work with Audrey around her community situation. While not explicitly labeled as a framework, Gene consistently returns to this model when helping clients calibrate their emotional responses to challenging situations. The metaphor of "building a 10-meter wall for 9 centimeters of water" effectively illustrates the concept.

**Framework Name:**  
"Three Modes of Transformation Support" (?? Synthesized)

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
- Mode 1: Planting Seeds (introducing new concepts/possibilities)
- Mode 2: Pulling Weeds (removing obstacles/limiting beliefs)
- Mode 3: Harvesting Fruit (facilitating breakthrough moments)

**Supporting Quote:**  
"Sometimes I am planting seeds, sometimes I am pulling weeds, sometimes I am harvesting fruit...all three of those are valuable in transformation."

**Commentary:**  
This framework was synthesized from Gene's discussion about the different ways practitioners can support transformation, even when immediate results aren't visible. It provides a useful mental model for practitioners to understand their various roles in the change process.
