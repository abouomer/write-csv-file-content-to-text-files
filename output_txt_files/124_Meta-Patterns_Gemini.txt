He offers practical strategies like setting phone reminders for self-care activities, creating menus of recharging activities, and simplifying decision-making when resources are low.

**Structural Form:**  Loop - Gene consistently returns to the concept of resource state management throughout the session, weaving it into individual coaching interactions and broader reflections on transformation.

**Teaching Impact:**  Reinforces the foundational role of self-care in navigating challenges and sustaining transformation. Normalizes the experience of emotional depletion and provides practical tools for managing it.

**Meta-Pattern Name:**  Externalizing Limiting Beliefs

**Teaching Impact:**  Empowers clients to question and dismantle internalized negative narratives, fostering self-compassion and opening up space for new perspectives.
