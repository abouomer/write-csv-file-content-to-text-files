Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – “Present ? Normalize ? Choose”

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- Step 1: Be Present to the Disruption  
  Tune into what is showing up emotionally, mentally, or physically. Rather than pushing it away or trying to interpret it, simply allow space to observe the responses without evaluation or force.
  
- Step 2: Normalize the Reaction  
  Acknowledge that the distress, grief, or fear is a valid and predictable reaction to change, loss, or trauma. Use tapping and language (e.g., “It makes sense I feel this way”) to soothe reactivity and reduce self-judgment.
  
- Step 3: Allow Emotional Processing  
  Give explicit permission to feel what’s happening, especially fear, grief, or anger, without immediately solving or fixing it. Recognize that simply naming and hearing the emotion begins to create internal space.
  
- Step 4: Wait for Emotional Settling  
  Let the system “slowly begin to normalize” after presence and recognition. Avoid jumping straight into action prematurely. Tapping is used here as a pacing and grounding tool.
  
- Step 5: Choose With Clarity  
  When equilibrium begins to return, revisit the situation and tell a different internal story from a more regulated place—allowing for values-based decisions, not fear-based reactions.

Supporting Quote:
“So I just give myself permission to be present to what is coming up in the moment… not evaluating it… and it will slowly begin to normalize, which will then give me the opportunity to decide what I want to change.” – Gene

Commentary:
This is an unstated and recurring arc Gene used with multiple participants across this office hours session. The structure emerges especially in his work with Lisa, Eden, and Laurel. The key pivot is delaying decision-making or action until emotional clarity returns, normalized through compassion and connection to the body experience.

Could be developed into a formal teaching metaphor—such as “Regulate ? Relate ? Respond” or “Pause to Pivot.” Gene teaches each of these elements, but not always with explicit naming.

Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – “Fear Updates: From Panic to Protocol”

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- Step 1: Identify the Fear Loop  
  Hone in on repeated mental rehearsals or catastrophizing loops. Ask: “What do you imagine will happen?” and then “What are you feeling in your body?”

- Step 2: Dialogue with the Sensation  
  Tap while asking the fear or body sensation what it believes will happen and what it’s trying to protect.

- Step 3: Dispute the Fear’s Logic  
  Use tapping and gentle inner questioning to ask: “What proof does this fear have?” and “Is this possible or probable?”

- Step 4: Present Safer, Truer Data  
  Reframe the fear by offering alternate, lived evidence or logical recognition. “I’ve gotten out of the tub hundreds of times without falling.” “Hypervigilance actually makes safe movement harder.”

- Step 5: Rehearse an Updated Scenario  
  Return to the original mental image or trigger—but now imagine it playing out with regulated, deliberate action rather than panic.

- Step 6: Generalize the Shift  
  Apply the reframe to additional edge cases: slippery steps, carrying items, other nuanced contexts. Observe if calm persists in varied versions of the trigger.

Supporting Quote:
“Instead, because of the fear right now, I am actually more likely to fall. Because I’m really tense… a part of me is trying to keep me safe, and is doing the exact opposite.”

Commentary:
This fear update protocol is fundamental to Gene’s EFT methodology. While not explicitly named here, the sequence—observe, dialogue, reframe, rehearse—repeats in both Laurel and Eden's sessions. There is clear connective tissue to a mechanics-of-tapping explainer Gene gave in this same session: opening the fear story, introducing contradictory but true new data, and reprocessing.

This procedural template is likely one of Gene’s core frameworks, albeit delivered through different metaphors in different moments.

Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – “Grief-as-Data Model”

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- Step 1: Identify the Emotional Tag Cloud  
  Ask “What are the things I’m afraid to lose?” or “What’s connected by grief or fear?” Acknowledge it isn’t isolated events; it’s emotionally tagged networks (“my house,” “my dog,” “my space.”)

- Step 2: Normalize the Emotional Overload  
  Let the client speak or tap through the overwhelm as the body tries to hold many tagged losses at once. Acknowledge it's more than sadness—it is fear of compounding loss.

- Step 3: Extract and Tap Through Emotional Blocking Beliefs  
  “I’m not allowed to grieve because I survived.” “If I let myself feel this loss, I might collapse.” Tap through those survival guilt gatekeepers with compassion.

- Step 4: Re-validate the Right to Grieve and Feel  
  Use phrases like “It’s okay to be grateful and still feel sad,” and “I can feel the loss without betraying the gratitude for what’s left.”

- Step 5: Mourn with Permission  
  Create safe space to actually feel and name the grief—furniture, pets, memories, disruptions to routines—not just trauma events.

- Step 6: Revisit with Perspective  
  Return to the object of fear (“my current house”), now from a softened, seasoned posture.

Supporting Quote:
“It is true I am lucky to be alive… but just because that is true, doesn't mean I'm not allowed to engage with the grief.”

Commentary:
This 6-part process unfolds across Gene’s work with Eden, as she moves through trauma reactivation about driving, safety, and losing her home. The emphasis on acknowledging grief as layered, complex, and often ungrievable due to guilt is especially valuable. While not diagrammed as such, it plays out clearly.

Connected to therapy models of "complicated grief,” but done with more immediacy and embodied safety.

Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – “Decluttering as Self-Concept Reconstruction”

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- Step 1: Surface the Emotional Baggage Around Objects  
  Prompt: “What does this object represent to me?” “What’s the story it ties to that I don’t know how to let go?”

- Step 2: Uncouple the Collective Identity  
  Reframe “the quilts,” “the baskets,” or “the piles” as individual pieces rather than a monolithic assignment or burden.

- Step 3: Create Permission for Granularity  
  Use a framework like: Keep / Maybe / Release. Emphasize “Maybe” is a legitimate choice and prevents premature cognitive fatigue or emotional resistance.

- Step 4: Regulate Emotional Attachments  
  Tap through guilt, grief, obligation, ancestral values, foisted identity (“I was the black sheep”), or epigenetic survival conditioning (“we must keep everything”) that blocks release.

- Step 5: Begin Gentle Reduction  
  Start with the least emotionally charged pile or object. Normalize that even small organization shifts can begin an energetic shift.

- Step 6: Return to Identity  
  Ask: “Am I holding onto this item because of who I am… or who I was supposed to become?”

Supporting Quote:
“I’m not dealing with piles of stuff. I’m dealing with my place in the universe.” (paraphrased from reflection with Brad)

Commentary:
This framework emerged from multiple conversations, but especially Brad, Anne, and Sue. It’s a profound integration of grief, identity, ancestral patterns, and the psychological weight of “stuff.” Gene surfaced how “organization” allows emotional clarity. He also reframes clutter not as laziness, but as emotional over-tagging that collapses a sense of self.

Deeply useful for coaching, minimalism, legacy work, and trauma-informed decluttering.

Framework Name: ?? Synthesized – “Two Minds Permission Loop”

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
- Step 1: Normalize Multiplicity  
  Introduce “I am allowed to be of two minds”—to feel gratitude and grief, joy and dread, love and loss. Reduce shame about contradiction.

- Step 2: Address Cultural Programming  
  Tap through inherited myths of linear thinking, decisiveness, or tidy closure. Challenge beliefs about needing certainty to act.

- Step 3: Rebuild Psychological Safety  
  Frame internal conflict not as disintegration, but as dimensional maturity. “The problem is not being confused—the problem is expecting clarity before safety.”

- Step 4: Return to Action With Emotional Complexity  
  Highlight: “I can still take action (turn left or right) even if I have emotional ambivalence. It’s okay for clarity to emerge post-action.”

- Step 5: Expand the Frame  
  Nested permission: “I can be of two minds about being of two minds.”

Supporting Quote:
“When I give myself permission to be of two minds, I feel better… even though it feels like I’m of no mind at all.”

Commentary:
Works beautifully for navigating loss, productivity paralysis, emotional ambivalence, or identity shifts. This logic defies binary or productivity culture teachings, but unlocks clarity for intellectual/emotional types. Linda’s session laid out its clearest pipeline.

Teachable as a stand-alone mindset shift in personal growth
