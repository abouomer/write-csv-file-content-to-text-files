**Mistake or Misstep:**  
"I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna be Teflon, and no matter what happens, I'm gonna be great. None of it's gonna hurt.” (Student's desire for invulnerability in a difficult family situation)

**Why It Fails:**
Unrealistic expectations set the student up for disappointment and increased pain. Families know our vulnerabilities, and difficult situations will likely trigger them.  Denying the potential for hurt makes the inevitable pain harder to process.

**Gene’s Alternative:**  
Acknowledge the difficulty, accept potential pain, and prioritize managing your resource state. Prepare simple self-care actions ahead of time to use when triggered.

**Why It Matters:**
Trying to be invulnerable prevents us from accessing the resources needed to navigate challenging situations. Acceptance and self-care allow us to respond more skillfully.

**Mistake Type:** Belief / Behavior / Energy

**Emotional Payoff:** Creates illusion of control, avoids anticipated pain.

**Teaching Soundbite:** “Strength isn't invulnerability.  Strength is resourcing yourself to navigate the inevitable.”

**Mistake or Misstep:**  
Presenting open-ended questions and multiple options to someone who is overwhelmed.

**Why It Fails:**  Overwhelm makes decision-making difficult. Open questions and options add to the cognitive load, hindering progress.

**Gene’s Alternative:**  
Present clear, concise statements outlining your understanding of the scope of work and responsibilities. Offer a single, well-defined plan.  This allows for easier feedback ("correct me if I'm wrong") and gives the overwhelmed person a concrete starting point.

**Why It Matters:**  Collaboration requires clear communication. When dealing with someone overwhelmed, providing clarity and direction facilitates more efficient decision-making and progress.

**Mistake Type:** Behavior / Relational

**Emotional Payoff:** Feels collaborative (initially), avoids potential conflict from making assumptions.

**Teaching Soundbite:**  “Clarity trumps collaboration when working with overwhelm.”

**Mistake or Misstep:**
Automatically discounting prices when asked, driven by a sense of obligation to help or rescue.

**Why It Fails:** This reinforces a pattern of undervaluing one's own time, skills, and services. It can lead to burnout and resentment.

**Gene’s Alternative:**  
Recognize the difference between thoughtfully offering services and being responsible for solving others' problems. Set clear boundaries and price services fairly based on the value provided and the overall cost, including client acquisition, and other business expenses, not just the time spent face-to-face.

**Why It Matters:**  Sustainable helping requires healthy boundaries and fair compensation. Discernment in offering services prevents rescuer dynamics and allows for more effective help.

**Mistake Type:** Belief / Behavior / Relational

**Emotional Payoff:** Avoids conflict, reinforces self-image as a helper, creates a sense of moral superiority.

**Teaching Soundbite:**  “Helping isn’t giving yourself away. Helping is a conscious exchange of value.”

**Mistake or Misstep:**  
Delaying action and overthinking pricing decisions, especially when there’s a fear of being judged or perceived as greedy.

**Why It Fails:** Procrastination and indecision create unnecessary stress and prevent opportunities for income.  Underpricing due to fear reinforces self-doubt.

**Gene’s Alternative:**
Recognize the transactional nature of selling artwork.  Research comparable pricing in your area and set prices that fairly reflect the value of your work and cover all expenses, including materials, labor, and commissions. Decouple your self-worth from sales outcomes.

**Why It Matters:**
Valuing your art and time allows you to participate fully in the market and earn a fair return for your creativity. Overcoming fear of judgment opens up opportunities for financial success.

**Mistake Type:**  Belief / Behavior

**Emotional Payoff:**  Avoids potential criticism, reinforces a sense of humility (false or otherwise).

**Teaching Soundbite:** “Price fairly, create freely. Your art has value, independent of sales.”

**Mistake or Misstep:**
Discounting pet-sitting rates based on the number of animals, assuming less work equals less value.

**Why It Fails:** This undervalues the overall disruption to one’s life and routine, which is present regardless of the number of animals.  It fails to account for experience, expertise, and the opportunity cost of not taking other work during that time.

**Gene’s Alternative:**  Establish a base rate that compensates for the disruption and time commitment.  Charge additional fees for extra services, travel, multiple pets, or other factors that add complexity.  View pet sitting as a valuable service with inherent worth, not a favor.

**Why It Matters:**  Fair pricing ensures sustainable income and reflects the true value of the service provided.  It allows pet sitters to earn a living while caring for animals.

**Mistake Type:** Belief / Behavior

**Emotional Payoff:** Avoids potential pushback on price, justifies accepting lower pay for “easy” work.

**Teaching Soundbite:** “Your time is valuable, even with one pet.  Price accordingly.”
