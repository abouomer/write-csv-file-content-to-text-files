**Resistance Theme:**  Compassion as a dangerous vulnerability, leading to enmeshment and a loss of self.

**Student Expression:**  “I’m afraid that if I really harden, I become less human...less sensitive...compassion is...I'm almost childlike. I'm very open...in my heart almost too much.”

**Psychological Mechanism:**  Fear of losing connection, even if that connection is unhealthy. Underlying belief that boundaries equate to rejection and abandonment. Potential secondary gain of maintaining a “helper” identity, even if it’s at personal cost.

**Energetic Signature:**  Collapse, childlike vulnerability, fear disguised as concern for others.

**Facilitation Opportunity:**  Tapping on the fear of hardening, exploring the nuances of compassion vs. sympathy, and reframing boundaries as self-care rather than rejection.  Introduce the idea of "detached compassion" - holding space for another's suffering without absorbing it.

**Resistance Theme:** Fear of failure leading to self-doubt and avoidance of helping others.

**Student Expression:** "I'm so afraid if I am doing a bad job...she might come to the conclusion, tapping won’t help...only because I made a bad job.”

**Energetic Signature:**  Anxiety, overthinking, catastrophizing.

**Facilitation Opportunity:**  Tapping on the fear of failure, separating self-worth from outcomes.  Reframing the narrative to focus on the process rather than the results. Explore the concept of "planting seeds" - even if tapping doesn't "work" immediately, it can plant seeds for future growth.

?? **Synthesized Resistance Theme:** The need to over-function and control outcomes as a way to manage anxiety and feel safe.  This is a recurring pattern across multiple student interactions, manifesting in different contexts: compassion as over-extension, fear of setting boundaries, fear of failure as a helper.

**Student Expression:**  Varied expressions across students, including  "I'm almost childlike. I'm very open...in my heart almost too much," "If I created a boundary, then...it's kind of like I...I have to stay in an unhealthy way", and "I'm so afraid if I am doing a bad job...she might come to the conclusion, tapping won’t help."

**Psychological Mechanism:**  Underlying anxiety and a belief that control is essential for safety.  Difficulty trusting others, oneself, and the process of life.

**Energetic Signature:**  Overthinking, hyper-responsibility, anxiety masked as concern for others.

**Facilitation Opportunity:**  Tapping on the need to control, exploring the possibility of surrendering to the process and trusting in a higher power or the wisdom of the body. Cultivating self-compassion and acceptance of imperfections.
