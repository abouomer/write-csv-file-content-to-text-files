**Contradiction Insight:**  
"Oftentimes the person who shows up with the plan gets their way" vs. "the reasonable way we start approach inside of collaboration."

**Tension Summary:**  
This highlights the tension between decisive action and collaborative exploration.  Presenting a pre-determined plan can be effective in achieving a desired outcome, but it may bypass the potential benefits of collaborative brainstorming and shared ownership.

**Commentary:**  
Gene's seemingly contradictory advice reflects his adaptability to different situations.  While he generally encourages collaborative problem-solving, he also recognizes that in situations with unresponsive or overwhelmed individuals, a more direct approach with a proposed plan can be necessary to make progress.  This demonstrates a practical, context-dependent approach to leadership and communication.

While the initial statements might imply a complete cessation of the unwanted emotional response, the clarification emphasizes a reduction in frequency or intensity, acknowledging the ongoing nature of personal growth.

**Commentary:**
This subtle contradiction reveals Gene's realistic perspective on personal transformation. He avoids promising complete eradication of ingrained patterns, instead emphasizing the incremental progress that is more typical of such work. This suggests an acceptance of ongoing challenges and the importance of celebrating even partial successes.
