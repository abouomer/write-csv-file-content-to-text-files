**Hidden Belief:**  
“If I feel grief for what I lost, I am ungrateful for what I still have.”

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Eden initially shared hypervigilance while driving, rooted in traumatic loss (a fire that destroyed her home). As she tapped into the fear and sadness, she said, “I’m alive and healthy… but I lost so much,” then added, “I feel like I’m not allowed to think about it because I survived.”

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene named the conflict directly:

“There’s a part of me that feels like I’m not allowed to engage the grief because I’m lucky to be alive… but just because that’s true doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to grieve what I lost.”

He gave her permission to hold dual perspectives (grief and gratitude), saying: “You’re allowed to appreciate what you have AND grieve what you lost.”

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  
This belief was sustaining Eden’s chronic tension and hypervigilance — especially during moments of safety. It prevented her from processing the trauma and feeling at home in her body, space, and relationships with things she loves.

**Hidden Belief:**  
“If I get rid of things my family made, I’m betraying them.”

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Both Anne and Brad described emotional paralysis around decluttering inherited items—especially handmade family quilts, baskets, and crafts. Anne said she felt “like a deer in headlights”; Brad felt “overwhelmed” but “waiting to die.” Emotional attachment carried weight beyond space — it implied duty, guilt, obligation.

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene broke the emotional fusion between “I love my family” and “I must keep the things.” He helped reframe items as individual objects — not a fused burden from family legacy. 

Gene: “You’re allowed to emotionally respond to SOMETHING from your family, instead of EVERYTHING your family gave you.”

He encouraged sorting without decision-making (“keep,” “maybe,” or “rehome” piles) to reduce overwhelm without violating legacy.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  
This belief locked participants in chronic avoidance, unable to face physical clutter or emotional grief. Either they irrationally kept everything (to stay in good graces with the dead) or dissociated from it altogether. It fueled stuck grief and tension.

**Hidden Belief:**  
“If I fully relax while doing something high-stakes, I become careless — and that makes the bad thing more likely.”

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Laurel described fearing she would fall when exiting her truck or bathtub, despite no history of falling. After tapping, she realized: “I see now that tensing up makes me MORE likely to fall — not less.”

Eden shared a similar state while driving — holding tension in her whole body, trying to avoid disaster.

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene offered a somatic reframe: “If I'm super tense while driving… or moving… I’m less good at it. The anxiety part is trying to keep you safe, but it’s making it worse.”

He described this as “updating the software” of the brain.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  
This belief created body rigidity and hypervigilance — ironically increasing the danger it was meant to prevent. Participants were locked in freeze/fight states, unconsciously worsening outcomes.

**Hidden Belief:**  
“If I allow two conflicting emotions at once, I lose control.”

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Linda visibly relaxed when Gene used the phrase “you can be of two minds.” Then she said: “It makes me feel like I don’t have control or structure—that I’m falling apart.” She equated emotional nuance with chaos.

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene offered a progressive reframe:

“You’re allowed to feel appreciation AND grief. You don’t need to be fully interiorly clear to take action. You can trust yourself to make decisions even while being of two minds.”

Linda eventually said: “If I turn right and it’s the wrong direction, I can just turn around.”

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  
High emotional suppression (in service of artificial clarity) led to control rigidity, shutdown, and delayed emotional processing. She equated coherence with safety — and compromise with collapse.

**Hidden Belief:**  
“If I clear clutter, I lose parts of myself.”

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Sue and Brad both described intense resistance to decluttering their own belongings—not just inherited ones. Sue said it felt like: “Oh no… like part of me is in those objects.” Brad described “piles everywhere” and said, “If I don’t think about it, I won’t feel how disappointed I am about my life.”

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene reframed clutter sorting as identity updating:

“Each object had a use, solved a problem, or gave me comfort at the time. But their purpose may now be obsolete.”

He encouraged organizing first—not purging. Sue felt emotional lightness as clarity emerged: “That feels doable.”

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  
This belief creates identity entanglement with things—where decluttering means amputating the past self. It drives hoarding, paralysis, and emotional weight inside the space.

**Hidden Belief:**  
“The only way to protect myself from loss is to never care too much.”

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Brad said: “If I don’t care about it, losing it won’t hurt me.” He described physical chaos (“piles everywhere”), ambivalence, and feeling like he’s “just waiting to die.”

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene contrasted this protective strategy with reality-based appreciation:

“The part of you trying to numb out is trying to keep you safe—but it’s also blocking joy. You can notice things without having to fix them all at once.”

He gave Brad emotional permission to “research” his attachments first—before changing anything.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  
Loss-fear led to flattened affect and spiritual disconnection. Brad didn’t feel entitled to want things, so he let them pile up.

**Hidden Belief:**  
“If I don’t do everything perfectly, loss is my fault.”

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Eden expressed extreme vigilance during “fire season” and driving. She attempted to block ALL possibility of disaster—because something unlikely already happened before. “No one can convince me the unlikely won’t happen again.”

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene said: “It’s not about pretending it’s impossible—it’s about recognizing that being afraid doesn’t make you safer. In fact, it impairs your perception and response.”

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  
This created a perfectionist trauma loop where Eden believed controlling everything was the only antidote to pain. It degraded her trust in presence, intuition, and nervous system regulation.
