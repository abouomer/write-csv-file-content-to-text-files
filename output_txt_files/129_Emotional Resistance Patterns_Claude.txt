Here are some key resistance patterns I identified from the transcript:

**Resistance Theme:**
"I must rescue/help others even at my own expense"

**Student Expression:**
"There is obligation...This is my lot in life...to rescue" (expressed with emotional heaviness and immediate recognition when named)

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Deep conditioning around self-sacrifice and helper identity, creating internal pressure to discount services and override personal boundaries/needs.

**Energetic Signature:**
Collapse and resignation when the helper pattern is triggered, followed by guilt and self-judgment for having boundaries.

**Facilitation Opportunity:**
- Reframe helping as requiring sustainable boundaries
- Validate both the helper instinct and need for self-care
- Explore pricing as honoring both giver and receiver
- Work with the core belief that helping must involve sacrifice

**Strategic Use Case:**
[Teaching Moment / Group Facilitation]
Helpful for working with practitioners around pricing and boundaries.

?? **Synthesized from multiple student interactions around pricing/boundaries/helping**

Note: This pattern emerged across multiple students but crystallized most clearly in the discussion about pet sitting pricing and photography pricing, revealing a common thread about the emotional complexities of valuing one's work and time.
