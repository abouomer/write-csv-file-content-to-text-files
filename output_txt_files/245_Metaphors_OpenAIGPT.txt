Metaphor:  
"It's like building a 10-meter wall for nine centimeters of water."

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
This metaphor clarifies the concept of disproportionate emotional responses stemming from unresolved trauma. It illustrates how, out of a need to feel safe, we construct oversized protective mechanisms (hypervigilance, avoidance, emotional shutdown) for threats that are no longer imminent. Specifically, it helps the student understand that fear-based reactions meant for survival can become excessive when the threat has passed, and that safety can be maintained without over-functioning.

Stickiness Factor:  
Highly visual and tactile — it immediately offers a mental image of an irrational overbuild. The concrete dimensions (meters, centimeters) ground the comparison in physical scale, giving the student instant emotional clarity. The unexpected scale disparity (10 meters vs. 9 centimeters) stirs surprise and reflection.

Transformation Type:  
Problem / Emotional Truth

Delivery Context:  
Used during a tapping sequence to help a student recalibrate their hypervigilant fear in a community setting. Emerged spontaneously in response to the student’s desire to protect herself after one frightening incident.

Metaphor:  
“When I am expressing compassion, that is not something I am extending to them. That is a channel I am opening up.”

What It Illustrates:  
This metaphor challenges the common assumption that compassion requires self-sacrifice or energetic enmeshment. It reframes compassion as an inner frequency rather than an outward gift, helping students separate emotional resonance from self-abandonment. It distinguishes the boundary between empathy and over-identification, key in healing work with difficult people.

Stickiness Factor:  
Subtle but elegant metaphor — casting compassion as a "channel" creates an internal, flowing, energetic image, which reframes the vulnerability often wrongly associated with compassion. It interrupts the binary of "either I care and get hurt" or "I harden and shut down."

Transformation Type:  
Identity Shift / Emotional Truth

Delivery Context:  
Spontaneously arose in interaction with a practitioner/student who was struggling to feel safe in holding compassionate awareness toward a compulsively lying family member.

Metaphor:  
“There’s stained glass between me and the issue — the emotions about the issue. And I can’t see it clearly until I remove the stained glass.”

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
Clarifies the transformational role that emotional processing plays in understanding a problem. The “stained glass” represents the refracted, colored misperceptions that emotions create around an issue. By tapping to resolve those emotions, the student gains a clearer mental and emotional view of the actual problem. It also affirms that distorted perception is a natural result of emotional charge.

Stickiness Factor:  
Emotionally and visually rich — stained glass connotes beauty and distortion. It elevates the emotional filter from being a problem to something intrinsic and human, while making the necessity of clearing that distortion feel manageable, even sacred.

Transformation Type:  
Process / Cognitive Reframe

Delivery Context:  
Used in explanation of how to work with emotional content without diving into the entirety of the issue up front. Offered as a teaching anchor during a helper's Q&A.

Metaphor:  
“Sometimes I’m planting seeds. Sometimes I’m pulling weeds. Sometimes I’m harvesting fruit.”

?? Synthesized

What It Illustrates:  
This metaphor outlines the helper’s role across the transformational timeline. It softens urgency or attachment to outcomes by situating the practitioner in a longer ecosystem of change. It provides relief to those worried they’re not doing “enough.” It’s a tool for self-compassion in helpers and a reminder of complexity in healing journeys.

Stickiness Factor:  
Agrarian and universally accessible. Metaphor supports multiple roles with vivid functionality — planting, weeding, harvesting — each evoked as purposeful, necessary, and actionable. Offers an organic cycle for ongoing client development that normalizes slow or unseen progress.

Transformation Type:  
Process / Helper Identity

Delivery Context:  
Taught during an office hour response to a practitioner struggling with feelings of inadequacy and fear that she wasn't "doing enough" for an overwhelmed client. Also helped deconstruct savior complex dynamics.

Metaphor:  
“The difference between failing and being a failure — one is an action, one is a state.”

What It Illustrates:  
This clean metaphor distinguishes between situational missteps and permanent identity labels. It locates self-compassion in a moment of regret and helps users reframe perceived regressions in behavior. It’s useful particularly for high-responsibility clients or practitioners who judge themselves harshly for an emotional reaction or mistake.

Stickiness Factor:  
Simple binary with huge impact. The distinction between “action” and “state” offers immediate relief and demystifies shame. It promotes internal curiosity and learning rather than self-attack. Usable across multiple client experiences.

Transformation Type:  
Identity Reframe / Emotional Truth

Delivery Context:  
Offered directly in response to someone who felt bad for gossiping after a moment of overstimulation and interpersonal stress in a community.

Metaphor:  
“Absolutes are for dumb people and children.”

What It Illustrates:  
This quote, though provocative, helps break binary or rigid thinking around emotional safety and boundaries. It invites practitioners and clients into the nuance of emotional response and decision-making. It’s delivered tongue-in-cheek, but makes a lasting point about flexibility and nervous system calibration.

Stickiness Factor:  
Unexpectedly blunt. Packs memorable punch through its irreverence. This disruptor metaphor is designed to “jog” mindset rather than soothe, making it potent for rumination or when stuck in black-or-white thinking.

Transformation Type:  
Problem / Cognitive Reframe

Delivery Context:  
Quoted from external podcast; invoked to talk about navigating lies without reacting from emotional absolutes.

Metaphor:  
“The part of me that wants to be safe thinks of this as all-or-nothing — either I’m a doormat or I shut the door.”

What It Illustrates:  
Frames the subconscious emotional patterning of hyper-vigilance and relational boundary collapse. Cleanly captures the interior logic of trauma-driven binary responses (connect completely or disconnect entirely). Opens the door to seeing middle paths in relational navigation.

Stickiness Factor:  
Simple language. Emotionally sticky because it mimics how many clients describe their lived experience. Restructures behavior as safety driven, not broken — reducing shame.

Transformation Type:  
Problem / Process

Delivery Context:  
Used in real-time with a client struggling to create boundaries with a compulsively lying family member.

Metaphor:  
“I was opening the soft underbelly of myself to them.”

What It Illustrates:  
Describes the felt-sense vulnerability that happens when we confuse compassion with unsafe emotional exposure. Helps clients name the internal bodily risk they feel when staying open to difficult or hurtful people. Validates the somatic response while separating it from the moral imperative to “stay kind.”

Stickiness Factor:  
Bodily vivid. “Soft underbelly” evokes animal defenselessness, evoking both the courage and danger of emotional openness. Offers somatic resonance even if the person can't logically define their collapse.

Transformation Type:  
Emotional Truth / Identity Shift

Delivery Context:  
Spontaneous language by client describing her experience of over-connecting to family member’s pain.

Metaphor:  
“You’re treating Gene as Google.”

What It Illustrates:  
Layers humor with clarity; illustrates the energetic boundary violation of clients or loved ones who turn the practitioner into their external solution machine. Helps helpers re-establish identity and shift toward empowered client ownership, emotional or logistical.

Stickiness Factor:  
Funny. Easy to remember and repeat. Reframes codependency via culture-literate metaphor (Google = source of all answers) with no clinical shaming.

Transformation Type:  
Boundary Clarity / Process Recalibration

Delivery Context:  
Spontaneous teaching to practitioner learning to affirm lived experience without jumping into fixing.
