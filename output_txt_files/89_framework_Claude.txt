Let me analyze this transcript for clear frameworks and models:

—
**Framework Name:**  
"?? Synthesized - The Course Tuning vs Fine Tuning Model"

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
- Step 1: Course Tuning - Step back to see the big picture/pattern (70,000 ft view)
- Step 2: Fine Tuning - Focus on specific details and individual elements
- Step 3: Assess which approach is needed for the current situation
- Step 4: Apply appropriate level of specificity based on emotional readiness

**Supporting Quote:**  
"Course tuning is me stepping back far enough back from the impressionistic painting to actually see the lily pads where fine tuning, as I'm so close to the impressionistic painting, all I see are the little bitty dots."

**Commentary:**  
This framework was synthesized from Gene's explanation of how to approach complex emotional situations, particularly around decluttering and processing grief. He indicates this is something he's been developing and plans to teach more formally later in the year. The metaphor of quantum mechanics and impressionist paintings makes it very teachable.

**Framework Name:**  
"The Three-Pile Decluttering System"

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
- Step 1: Create Keep Pile
- Step 2: Create Get Rid Of Pile  
- Step 3: Create Maybe Pile
- Step 4: Make immediate decisions on clear items (1-25%)
- Step 5: Return to Maybe pile after time/distance
- Step 6: Repeat process with remaining Maybe items

**Supporting Quote:**  
"One of the activities I love doing when I'm decluttering is I have three piles. I have keep, I have get rid of, and I have maybe..."

**Commentary:**  
This is a clearly defined process Gene uses and teaches for decluttering. The maybe pile serves as a psychological buffer that makes the process less overwhelming.
