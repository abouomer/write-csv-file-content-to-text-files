Based on the transcript, here are the key teaching process patterns I've identified:

—
**Process Pattern Name:** 
"Contextual Reframing Loop"

**Sequence Overview:**
- Phase 1: Acknowledge current reality/challenge
- Phase 2: Expand perspective to include larger context
- Phase 3: Return to specific situation with new framework
- Phase 4: Apply practical steps within new context

**Commentary:**
Gene consistently uses this pattern across multiple client interactions - with Debbie on pricing services, Anne on art pricing, and Maggie on pet sitting rates. He first validates their immediate concern, then zooms out to show broader context (e.g. business principles, market dynamics), before returning to their specific situation with actionable steps. This pattern helps clients shift from emotional reactions to strategic thinking.

**Process Pattern Name:**
"?? Synthesized - Resource State Management Arc"

**Sequence Overview:**
- Phase 1: Identify current resource state
- Phase 2: Acknowledge limitations/constraints
- Phase 3: Create concrete support structures
- Phase 4: Plan for ongoing maintenance

**Commentary:**
This pattern emerges across multiple client interactions where Gene helps them manage their emotional and energetic resources. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing resource state, planning ahead for depletion, and creating specific tools/reminders to maintain it.

These patterns demonstrate Gene's systematic approach to both cognitive reframing and emotional resource management in client work.
