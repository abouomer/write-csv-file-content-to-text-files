**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
"Tap and notice…don’t process, don’t…do anything other than just paying attention to what is going on and just be present to what is going on.”

**Contrasted Against:**  
The expectation of immediate analysis, problem-solving, or trying to fix or change the emotional experience.

**Why It Matters:**  
Creates safety and allows the nervous system to regulate without the pressure of forced or premature processing.  Facilitates natural unfolding and insight.

**Level of Contrast:**

**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
“Because of the fear right now, I'm actually more likely to fall because I'm really tense and it's hard to move in a healthy way when I'm really tense.”

**Contrasted Against:**  
Fear as a purely protective mechanism, anxiety as helpful.

**Why It Matters:**  
Reframes anxiety’s role, revealing how it can *increase* risk rather than mitigate it. This opens the door for a different relationship with anxiety.

**Level of Contrast:**  
Philosophy

**Positioning Soundbite:**  
Tension increases risk.

**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
“[Reframes are] conveying new information. We’re updating the software…bringing it [the fear response] the information of how to actually keep you safe…That's the reason why…we're imagining a friend coming to us and we're saying the information to them…we do a much better job of coming up with those specific reframes.”

**Contrasted Against:**  
Traditional self-talk or positive affirmations that often feel inauthentic or ineffective against deeply rooted fears.

**Why It Matters:**  
Disassociation through the “friend” visualization creates emotional distance, enabling more effective reframing and information processing.  

**Level of Contrast:**  
Tactic / Philosophy

**Positioning Soundbite:**  
Update your fear software.

**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
"It's not buckets…[like] the food bucket…the drink bucket…Instead, it's almost like everything has tags associated with it…So right now what we're doing is [tapping on] losing valuable things…we've clicked the tag that says valuable things…and after we've responded to the first one, the next one comes bubbling up because we're worried about losing that important, valuable thing as well."

**Contrasted Against:**  
Approaching issues in isolation, or compartmentalizing emotions rather than recognizing interconnectedness.

**Why It Matters:**  
Explains the “jumping around” phenomenon in tapping, validating the client’s experience and highlighting the interconnected nature of emotions and experiences.  Allows for a more holistic approach to healing.

**Level of Contrast:**  
Philosophy / Tactic

**Positioning Soundbite:**  
Emotions are tagged, not bucketed.

**Unique Positioning Insight:**
"There is course tuning…stepping back far enough back from the impressionistic painting to actually see the lily pads…And when we are tapping, there is value in fine tuning and there is value in course tuning…course tuning is…being specific about the big picture. It's not about being specific about a detail inside of the big picture."

**Contrasted Against:**
Always starting with the smallest, most specific detail or memory in tapping.

**Why It Matters:**
Provides a framework for approaching large, complex issues (like grief, life purpose) where hyper-specificity can be overwhelming or even counterproductive in the beginning.

**Level of Contrast:**
Philosophy / Tactic

**Positioning Soundbite:**
Course tune before fine-tuning.  Big picture tapping.

**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
“[When you talk about the quilts collectively] you are emotionally responding to it as if it is *a thing*. And so…it’s not what do I do with the baskets? What do I do with the blankets? It’s what do I do with *this* basket? What do I do with *this* blanket?”

**Contrasted Against:**
Overwhelm and decision paralysis when facing large collections of emotionally charged objects. The pressure to treat items uniformly when “letting go.”

**Why It Matters:**  
Allows for a gentler, more nuanced approach to decluttering/releasing items tied to family history. Makes the process less all-or-nothing, creating space for individual choices.

**Level of Contrast:**  
Tactic / Mindset

**Positioning Soundbite:**  
Individual, not monolithic choices.

?? **Synthesized Insight:**
"The things that I have gathered I gathered for a reason. They were useful. They were beautiful. There's an emotional connection. Some of them make me feel better. Some of them solve a problem. And so I have a *relationship* with the objects…emotionally and subconsciously I am dealing with it as an all or nothing proposition. I either keep it all or get rid of it all."

**Contrasted Against:**  
Viewing possessions impersonally, judging oneself for emotional attachment to “stuff.”  Decluttering as purely a logistical or organizational exercise.

**Why It Matters:**  
Acknowledges the valid reasons behind accumulating items and the emotional weight of letting go, making the process feel less like a personal failing and more like navigating complex emotional terrain.  

**Level of Contrast:**  
Mindset / Emotional Posture

**Positioning Soundbite:**
It’s not about stuff; it's about relationships.
