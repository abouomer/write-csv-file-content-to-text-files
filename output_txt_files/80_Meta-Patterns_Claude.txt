Here are the key teaching meta-patterns I observed in Gene's facilitation:

**Meta-Pattern Name:** "Acknowledgment-Before-Reframe Loop"

**Patterned Behavior:**
Gene consistently acknowledges and validates the current emotional experience/belief before introducing any alternative perspective. He does this through phrases like "it makes sense that..." followed by gentle questioning or offering another viewpoint.

**Structural Form:**
Loop pattern: Acknowledge ? Validate ? Question/Reframe ? Return to acknowledgment if needed

**Teaching Impact:**
Creates emotional safety by honoring the current experience while gently opening space for new perspectives. Reduces resistance and defensiveness.

**Meta-Pattern Name:** "Scale-Not-Switch Reframe"

**Patterned Behavior:** 
When someone presents a binary/either-or situation, Gene consistently reframes it as a spectrum or scale with many points between extremes. Uses analogies and questions to illustrate the middle ground.

**Structural Form:**
Binary position ? Question assumptions ? Introduce spectrum ? Explore middle ground

**Teaching Impact:**
Helps break black-and-white thinking patterns while maintaining psychological safety. Opens up new possibilities for action.

**Reuse Strategy:**
- Decision-making facilitation
- Conflict resolution
- Personal development coaching
- Change management

Note: These patterns appear consistently across multiple sessions, though this example shows them particularly clearly in the conversation about emotional boundaries and proportionate response.
