Resistance Theme:  
“If I show up with my full value, people will resent me — so I should shrink or discount myself to stay safe or be liked.”

Student Expression:  
“I was instantly thinking how much can I discount my price?”  
“There was part of me that believes I’m rejecting a struggling mother if I don’t help.”  
“How dare she think her work is worth that much?” (Projection gathered from art-pricing segment)  
“I charged more for 6 cats and 2 dogs — this is just one dog. Maybe I need to scale it down.”

Psychological Mechanism:  
This is driven by a combination of childhood-acquired worthiness patterns and helper identity conditioning. The internalized belief is: to be good, safe, or accepted — especially as a helper or creative — I must over-accommodate or undervalue myself to avoid being seen as selfish, greedy, or uncaring. Discount reflex operates as an avoidance of relational tension or judgment.

Energetic Signature:  
Defensive minimization, flinching guilt, collapse masked in compliance. Quick reflex to justify reducing rates before any outer conflict emerges. Preemptive appeasement energy.

Facilitation Opportunity:  
Explore and reprogram the substructure of “value = sacrifice,” using reframes like: “Helping doesn’t require depleting,” or “My fair value invites respect, not rejection.” Create tapping scripts around agency, resource exchange, and self-worth for helpers. Use group shares or stories to decouple resentment from high pricing. Task: write and tap through a clear “why” statement for value-based pricing.

Resistance Theme:  
“If I don’t respond perfectly, or as I usually do, something is wrong with me.”

Student Expression:  
“I’ve had the opportunity to sell prints this whole month... and I just couldn’t do it.”  
“This is not like me. I NEVER miss deadlines.”  
“I don’t know why I stalled — I had questions and just didn’t ask them.”  
Debbie and Student 4 both express dismay at their own emotional reaction: “I shouldn’t be upset like this anymore.”

Psychological Mechanism:  
Conditional self-valuation: Self-worth becomes enmeshed with ideal behavior or performance consistency. The ego uses prior positive identity (e.g., “I’m a clear-boundary person” or “I’m not a procrastinator”) as a standard, making any deviation into a threat-trigger that queues self-criticism. There is resistance to being messy or human.

Energetic Signature:  
Mild spiral of shame masked as self-inquiry. Underlying collapse into "why am I like this?" rumination. Evaluation tone sharpened by heat of inner scolding. Hidden grief of self-abandonment.

Facilitation Opportunity:  
Reframe the inner narrative: “It makes sense I got stuck — this is emotionally new terrain.” Use tapping to normalize regression under novelty or perceived stakes. Teach the "meta-emotion" model — fear about having emotions — and model indulgent self-tolerance. Design journaling or group exercises that disentangle behavior from identity.

Resistance Theme:  
“If I emotionally prepare enough, maybe I won’t feel pain. But if I hurt, it means I did it wrong.”

Student Expression:  
“I want to show up strong, and not let this hurt me.”  
“I want to comprehend without it hurting.”  
“I always end up protecting everyone.”  
“It brings back things from when she was mean to me as a kid.”

Psychological Mechanism:  
Desire for emotional invulnerability as a defense against loss, grief, and unresolved childhood trauma. This is partly a hypervigilant protector coping strategy — believing that hurt equals failure of preparation or evolution. Self-worth attaches to being unshakeable.

Energetic Signature:  
Over-efforting. Bravado tapering into fragility. Thoughtful precision tinged with fear of collapse. The perfectionistic grief-avoidance wrapped in hope.

Facilitation Opportunity:  
Tap into paradox: “Even if I prepare fully, it might still hurt — and that’s not a mistake. That’s proof I loved.” Teach anticipatory grief as valid. Normalize longing for control in uncontrollable emotional systems. Use group confession as portal to grief-processing.

Resistance Theme:  
“If I don’t get super-clear direction, I might be blamed later — so I overfunction, over-communicate, and still feel unsafe.”

Student Expression:  
“She doesn’t answer full emails. I ask 3 questions and get 1 answer.”  
“She won’t meet with me — I don’t want this to blow back on me later.”  
“I feel like I’ll get blamed when it goes sideways.”

Psychological Mechanism:  
Hyper-responsibility loop rooted in past experiences of scapegoating, poorly mapped power, or diffuse authority roles. Instead of assuming normal ambiguity in imperfect systems, the nervous system responds as if personal failure or humiliation is imminent.

Energetic Signature:  
Background tension. Strategic over-explanation. Control-seeking posture hiding anticipatory dread. Frozen forward energy — doing more to prevent vague threat.

Facilitation Opportunity:  
Create somatic safety by validating “invisibility” or boundary-breach fears. Tap on worst case outcomes: “If I get blamed, what does that mean about me?” Support narrative detoxing around workplace trauma — especially blurry power roles. Build assertiveness muscle for bottom-lining unclear processes.

Resistance Theme:  
“If I admit this hurts while she’s still alive, it might mean I’ve failed as a daughter or practitioner.”

Student Expression:  
“I’m already missing parts of her — but she’s still here.”  
“There’s this sadness when she doesn’t recognize me.”  
“It’s hard — I want to do it without it hurting.”

Psychological Mechanism:  
Ambiguous grief. The mind cannot fully grieve a person who still lives — yet part of them is already gone. This creates a clashing loop of loyalty, love, and helplessness: the subconscious resists full mourning until death, while the emotional body is already mourning. Layered guilt emerges as a hidden barrier.

Energetic Signature:  
Whispered sorrow. Collapse softened by love. Hesitant disorientation. Stoicism covering lonely ache.

Facilitation Opportunity:  
Encourage rituals of mid-life mourning. Widen permission to feel loss in stages — even before death. Use surrogate tapping and narrative expression to build bridges between remembered self and current self of the family member. Frame care as legacy tending.
