**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
“It is possible that it is impossible for you not to be hurt in this process… I want to be as strong and as capable as possible, and I want this to hurt as little as possible… Sometimes we're in a circumstance where we're picking between two crappy things, which means that when we pick between two crappy things, we end up with something that is far from perfect and as possibly painful.”

**Contrasted Against:**  
The expectation of achieving a perfect, painless resolution in challenging family situations, particularly those involving dementia.  The idea that one can remain completely unaffected or "Teflon" in such scenarios.

**Why It Matters:**  
This sets realistic expectations and validates the client’s potential for pain, making the approach feel safer and more accepting of the messy realities of family dynamics. It normalizes the experience of emotional difficulty, reducing shame and self-criticism.

**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
"Oftentimes the person who shows up with the plan gets their way… which is different than… asking ‘what are the possible solutions?’ and then mine becomes one of many or mine becomes caught up in a quagmire of people not making decisions.”

**Contrasted Against:**  
The collaborative approach of brainstorming solutions together, which can be ineffective when dealing with unresponsive or overwhelmed individuals.

**Why It Matters:**  
Provides a practical strategy for moving forward when traditional collaboration fails.  Empowers clients to take charge and increases their chances of achieving desired outcomes in situations where others are struggling to make decisions.

**Unique Positioning Insight:**
“I want to be in a circumstance in which the people in my life maintain my boundaries for me… Until we get to that point, we need to maintain our boundaries…we emotionally struggle with maintaining boundaries."

**Contrasted Against:**
The ideal scenario where others intuitively respect our boundaries, versus the reality that we often have to actively establish and enforce them, especially during personal growth.

**Why It Matters:**
Normalizes the struggle with boundary setting and encourages clients to take ownership of their limits, even when it's emotionally challenging. Emphasizes that maintaining boundaries is a process, not a destination.

**Level of Contrast:**
Philosophy / Identity

**Positioning Soundbite:**  
"Own your boundaries, even when it's hard."

**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
"Revenge fantasies aren't necessarily always unhealthy… There's two ways that I'm caught in an emotional spin: One is a record player… The other way…is a ball of yarn… you got caught in the emotional spin, but you didn't stay stuck."

**Contrasted Against:**  
The common belief that all negative emotions, including revenge fantasies, are inherently bad and should be suppressed.  Also contrasts against the idea of being trapped in a repetitive emotional cycle without agency.

**Why It Matters:**  
Reduces shame around having negative emotional responses.  Highlights Gene’s focus on processing emotions constructively, emphasizing movement and evolution rather than stagnation. The yarn analogy offers a tangible image of emotional unraveling and progress.

**Positioning Soundbite:**

**Unique Positioning Insight:**
"I am not pricing for the time that I'm spending with a person. I am pricing for everything that's involved in that fulfillment…the money I make from the time I spend has to cover all of that time as well… client acquisition…the time and energy it takes me to put people on my calendar.”

**Contrasted Against:**
The common practice of solely valuing billable hours rather than incorporating the full scope of business operations, including client acquisition and administrative tasks, into pricing.

**Why It Matters:**
Provides a holistic and sustainable approach to pricing that accounts for the true cost of doing business, empowering practitioners to value their time and expertise appropriately.

**Level of Contrast:**  
Tactic / Philosophy

**Positioning Soundbite:**
"Price the process, not just the session."

**Unique Positioning Insight:**  
“[Clients] are dissatisfied with their response or their emotional response.  There's the story that happened and then there's the meaning that we are writing… How did I get caught in a place that I normally don't get caught in? …the meta commentary on the experience.”

**Contrasted Against:**  
Focusing solely on the external problem without examining the internal experience and meaning-making process.  Contrasts a reactive approach with a reflective one.

**Why It Matters:**  
Demonstrates a deeper level of self-awareness and a focus on metacognition—thinking about thinking. This highlights Gene’s approach as going beyond surface-level solutions to address the root causes of emotional challenges and behavioral patterns.  It showcases a more sophisticated understanding of the transformational process.

**Level of Contrast:**  
Philosophy / Identity

**Positioning Soundbite:**
