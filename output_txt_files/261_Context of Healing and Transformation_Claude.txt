### ?? Synthesis Note:
The transcript reveals several key themes about context in healing:

1. Resource state is fundamental - our capacity to engage, heal, and transform is directly tied to our current energy and circumstance.

2. Environmental triggers can reactivate old patterns - physical spaces and situations can automatically shift us into previous emotional states.

3. Safety is contextual - what feels safe in one context may not in another, requiring flexible response patterns.

4. The healing relationship itself provides context - how safe someone feels with a practitioner shapes their ability to engage.

These themes suggest structuring training around understanding both internal context (resource state, emotional capacity) and external context (environment, relationships, timing) in healing work.
