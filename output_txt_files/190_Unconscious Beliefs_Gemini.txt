**Hidden Belief:** If I create boundaries in close relationships, those relationships will end.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Student 1 struggles with setting boundaries with a family member who is a compulsive liar, stating that setting a boundary feels like it would end the relationship.  "If I created a boundary, then... it's kind of like... I have to stay in an unhealthy way...healthiest way for me would be to leave."

**Reframing Response:** Gene uses a guided tapping sequence to help Student 1 see that boundaries are not an all-or-nothing proposition. He helps her recognize her subconscious belief and consider that there might be a middle ground between being completely open and completely closed off.  "There's a part of me that believes this is an all or nothing proposition...I'm either fully engaged, or I'm fully disconnected...And I have decided it is true...And since I'm not allowed to have them out of my life, then they have to be beyond my boundaries in the inside...And that might be true...I'm also open to the possibility that it's not [an] all or nothing proposition."

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  Student 1's difficulty setting boundaries leads to feelings of exhaustion, resentment, and being hurt in her relationships with family members.

**Hidden Belief:** If tapping doesn't work for someone I work with, it's because I did a bad job / I am a bad practitioner.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Student 3 expresses hesitancy to work with a potential client who is experiencing burnout, overwhelmed, and various challenges. She questions her ability to help and worries about the client concluding tapping doesn't work if the sessions aren't successful. "I'm not sure if I can really offer it so she's safe...I want to avoid tapping with her...I'm only thinking that I can't offer it for her to be safe because I want to avoid tapping with her because it would [take] eight sessions and I can't offer decades of experience...I'm so afraid if I am doing a bad job, she might come to the conclusion, tapping won't help. Even though tapping would be great to help, but only because I made a bad job."


**Reframing Response:** Gene challenges Student 3's belief that she has absolute control over the outcome of the sessions. He uses humor to highlight the unrealistic nature of this belief, then emphasizes that success depends on multiple factors, including the client's readiness and willingness to engage. He also points out the inherent value of exploring emotions and underlying beliefs, even if the tapping itself doesn't lead to immediate transformation.  "I appreciate the fact that you understand your unwavering power of persuasion over other people. That you are the, the absolute truth on all things, and if it doesn't work with you, it doesn't work in the universe. I'm glad you're aware of that fact...I recognize the fact that I want this to work. And I also recognize the fact there are always going to be degrees of success and sometimes I have an impact on how much success happens and sometimes I don't have an impact."  He then shares a story about his own initial negative experience with tapping, illustrating how even a "failed" introduction can plant seeds for future growth. He also emphasizes the importance of focusing on the client's emotional experience and the meaning they give to their story, regardless of whether tapping leads to a complete resolution.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  Student 3's fear of failure is causing her to avoid potentially valuable client work and limiting her professional growth.

**Hidden Belief:** I am not safe in my community (after past negative experience).

**Surfacing Trigger:** Student 2 describes an overreaction to community meetings after experiencing an aggressive outburst from a male community member.  "Ever since I'm reacting in a weird way, whenever I go to community meetings...I'm having the whole system, and it, it's probably not proportionate anymore...I can't sleep for three nights, which is, isn't, doesn't feel proportionate."

**Reframing Response:** Gene guides Student 2 through a tapping sequence that acknowledges her fear while differentiating between the past threat and the current situation. He emphasizes the importance of keeping safe while also recognizing that her current level of vigilance might be excessive. He helps her see that reducing her fear does not equate to being reckless or careless, and that a middle ground is possible. "...it makes sense that there is a part of me that wants me to be safe. And it recognizes because there was danger before...whenever I interact with the community...it makes sense. My subconscious mind remembers that instance...whenever I am around that person, it makes sense that I remember that difficult experience...there is a part of me that wants me to be safe and never wants me to deal with that again...There is a difference between keeping myself safe and really, really working hard to keep me safe. In some ways it is like building a 10 meter wall for nine centimeters of water… I definitely need to keep the water out, but I don’t need 10 meters to keep it out.”

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  Student 2's fear is leading to hypervigilance, sleeplessness, and potentially isolating her from her community.
