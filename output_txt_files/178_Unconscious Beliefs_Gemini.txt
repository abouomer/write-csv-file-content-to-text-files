**Hidden Belief:** If I create boundaries with close family, I will no longer be in relationship with them. / If I create boundaries, they will leave.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Student struggles with maintaining compassion with a family member who is a compulsive liar, saying setting boundaries feels like “hardening” and becoming “less human."  Later clarifies "If I created a boundary, then it'd be just like, yeah, it's, it's kind of like, I, I have to stay in an unhealthy way, uh-huh, because healthiest way for me would be to leave.”

**Reframing Response:** Gene challenges the student's all-or-nothing thinking around boundaries, reframing compassion as understanding without enmeshment. He guides her through a tapping script acknowledging the belief while opening to other possibilities beyond disconnection. Gene also normalizes the difficulty of setting boundaries in close relationships and offers the strategy of small, consistent behavioral shifts to renegotiate dynamics.  He further suggests mentally rehearsing alternative responses in hindsight to prepare for future interactions.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** Student exhibits black-and-white thinking, feeling “childlike” and overly open, or completely shut down.  This belief drives her struggle to balance compassion with self-preservation in family dynamics.

**Hidden Belief:** If tapping with a client isn’t “successful,” it’s my fault (because I did a bad job).  If the client doesn’t experience complete transformation in a few sessions, it means tapping has failed because of me. / If a client doesn’t have a transformational experience, I am a bad practitioner.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Student expresses hesitation to work with a client presenting multiple complex issues, questioning if she can “really offer it so she’s safe,” and whether a few sessions are sufficient. She admits to avoiding the client because she can’t offer "decades of experience" and fears making a "bad job" leading the client to conclude “tapping won’t help.”

**Reframing Response:** Gene reframes the idea of success in tapping, emphasizing that even content-free tapping addresses underlying emotional issues connected to the presenting problem. He highlights the importance of exploring the client's *emotions about* the issue as a gateway to clarity and potential transformation.  Gene further underscores the value of small steps, normalizing that transformation may be a gradual process, sometimes involving planting seeds or pulling weeds rather than immediate harvesting. He uses his personal anecdote of a poorly executed tapping introduction—which nonetheless sparked his interest—to illustrate that indirect impact and delayed results are still impactful.  Gene also normalizes not receiving credit for contributions as a helper, suggesting this doesn't diminish the value of the work.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** Student’s fear of failure and responsibility for clients' outcomes leads her to avoid engaging with a client’s complex situation.

**Hidden Belief:** If I'm not hypervigilant and afraid, I will be reckless and careless. /  Safety requires constant vigilance, and any lessening of fear equates to irresponsible behavior.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Student describes an outsized reaction to a past aggressive incident in her community, experiencing high anxiety and sleeplessness after community meetings, even months later. This suggests a belief that her safety depends on constant vigilance and fear.

**Reframing Response:** Gene acknowledges the validity of her initial fear and the need for safety, while gently challenging the all-or-nothing thinking that equates reduced fear with recklessness. He uses the analogy of a 10-meter wall built for nine centimeters of water, highlighting the disproportionate response. He guides her through a tapping script, emphasizing the possibility of finding a middle ground between hypervigilance and carelessness.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  Student exhibits an exaggerated fear response, including sleeplessness and avoidance behaviors, disproportionate to the actual level of threat in her community.
