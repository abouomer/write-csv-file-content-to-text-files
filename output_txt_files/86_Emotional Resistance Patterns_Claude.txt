Here are the key resistance patterns I identified from the transcript:

**Resistance Theme:** "If I'm not hypervigilant, I'll be unsafe"
**Student Expression:** "...and ever since I'm reacting in a weird way, whenever I go to community meetings, I'm trying to make sure there's other people around...after any community meeting, I can't sleep for three nights"
**Psychological Mechanism:** Past trauma/threat has created an overactive protective response that generalizes the danger beyond the specific person/situation to the entire community context
**Energetic Signature:** Anxious hypervigilance, sleep disruption, emotional overwhelm
**Facilitation Opportunity:** Using metaphor (10m wall for 9cm of water) to help calibrate appropriate protective response while honoring the valid need for safety
**Strategic Use Case:** [Tapping Script / Group Facilitation]

**Resistance Theme:** "If I'm not perfect in helping others, I'll damage them"
**Student Expression:** "I'm so afraid if I am doing a bad job...she might come to the conclusion tapping won't help"
**Psychological Mechanism:** Over-responsibility for others' healing journey combined with perfectionism creates hesitation to engage
**Energetic Signature:** Anxious constraint, self-doubt masking as responsibility
**Facilitation Opportunity:** Reframing role as seed-planter vs solely responsible for harvest; normalizing incremental progress
**Strategic Use Case:** [Teaching Moment / Group Facilitation]

These patterns show how safety fears and perfectionism can create resistance loops that feel protective but ultimately constrain growth and service.
