Here are two key teaching contrasts I identified from Gene's guidance in this session:

—
**Mistake or Misstep:**
"I must maintain constant vigilance and maximum protective barriers when feeling unsafe" (synthesized from dialogue with student about over-functioning in response to a threatening situation)

**Why It Fails:**
Over-protection drains resources, creates exhaustion, and actually makes us less effective at recognizing real threats versus perceived ones. The emotional cost outweighs the protective benefit.

**Gene's Alternative:**
Build "appropriate height walls" - protection proportionate to the actual threat level. Maintain awareness while avoiding over-functioning.

**Why It Matters:**
Constant hypervigilance prevents healing and keeps trauma active. Right-sized protection allows us to stay safe while preserving energy for growth.

**Mistake Type:** Energy/Behavioral

**Teaching Soundbite:**
"Don't build 10-meter walls for 9 centimeters of water"

**Mistake or Misstep:**
"I must get every intervention exactly right or I'll damage my client/ruin tapping for them forever" (synthesized from practitioner anxiety discussion)

**Why It Fails:**
Perfectionism creates hesitation and self-doubt that prevents practitioners from being present and responsive. Over-responsibility for outcomes.

**Gene's Alternative:**
Focus on being helpful in the moment while recognizing you're part of their longer journey. Plant seeds, pull weeds, or harvest fruit - all are valuable contributions.

**Why It Matters:**
Releasing the burden of perfect intervention allows practitioners to show up authentically and meet clients where they are.

**Mistake Type:** Belief/Identity

**Teaching Soundbite:** 
"We're either planting seeds, pulling weeds, or harvesting fruit - all matter"
