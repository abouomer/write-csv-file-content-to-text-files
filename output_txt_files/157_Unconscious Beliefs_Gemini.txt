**Hidden Belief:** If I get sick, it's because I unconsciously want to avoid dealing with difficult emotions or situations.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Lisa mentions she never gets sick, then speculates her current illness might be "for a reason," keeping her brain "numb" so she can't think too much.  "I never get sick. Mm-hmm. I never get sick.
I mean, I haven't been sick in 20 years. I am so sick. And I think there's, that's for a reason too. Mm-hmm. And it's keeping my brain kind of numb so it can't think too much about anything."

**Reframing Response:** Gene doesn't directly address this belief, but focuses on tapping to help Lisa be present with her emotions without judgment or the need to change them immediately. This indirectly challenges the idea that illness is the only way to numb difficult feelings. He encourages presence with the difficult feelings rather than avoidance.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  This belief could be contributing to Lisa's resistance to fully process her feelings about her life situation. The illness may be serving as a temporary escape from confronting her unhappiness.

**Hidden Belief:** I am not allowed to grieve or process loss if I am still alive and healthy. Others have it worse, so my grief is invalid.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Eden's sadness about losing her home emerges after tapping on her fear of driving. The sadness escalates into a fear of losing her current home and dog, suggesting an underlying avoidance of processing the initial trauma.

**Reframing Response:** Gene validates Eden's grief, emphasizing she's "allowed to engage with the sadness even though [she's] alive." He directly challenges the idea that gratitude negates grief. "I give myself permission to know, even though the sadness is so big, even though the sadness is so big, it is safe for me to engage with the sadness. It's safe for me to engage with the sadness even though I am alive, even though I'm alive. I am still allowed to engage with the loss."

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** This belief likely fuels Eden's anxiety and hypervigilance, as she tries to prevent further loss while suppressing the pain of past trauma.

**Hidden Belief:** If I don't care about things, losing them won't hurt me.  Apathy is a shield against pain.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Brad's lack of motivation to deal with his cluttered environment, combined with the feeling of "waiting to die," suggests a deep-seated emotional detachment. He states this belief almost directly: "if I don't care about it, losing it won't hurt me."

**Reframing Response:** Gene encourages Brad to explore his feelings related to his space and the transition, emphasizing noticing without judgment.  He doesn't directly challenge the belief yet, but creates space for Brad to explore its roots.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** This belief manifests as inertia and lack of purpose, hindering Brad's ability to create a fulfilling life.

?? **Synthesized Hidden Belief (Brad):** I must find a "good home" for everything, otherwise I'm disrespecting my parents/the past.  This belief fuels my inaction and contributes to the clutter.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Brad's mention of his parents' Depression-era mentality of saving everything, combined with his feeling of disrespecting them if he throws things away, points to an inherited belief system around possessions.

**Reframing Response:** Gene acknowledges the influence of Brad's parents' experiences and suggests exploring the potential epigenetic and learned components of this belief. He emphasizes the abundance mindset as a counterpoint to the scarcity mentality.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:**  This belief prevents Brad from decluttering, creating a physical and emotional burden.

**Hidden Belief:** I must be decisive and have a single, clear perspective.  Being of two minds means being out of control, which is dangerous.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Linda's discomfort with the concept of "two minds" reveals her belief that conflicting emotions are unsafe and undesirable.

**Reframing Response:** Gene validates the cultural pressure to be decisive while emphasizing the validity and even healthiness of holding multiple perspectives. He taps with Linda on allowing herself to be of two minds and trusting her ability to navigate this complexity.  He reframes it as a skill to be developed, not a weakness.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** This belief could lead to rigidity, difficulty adapting to change, and suppression of authentic feelings.

**Hidden Belief:** Inherited items are a monolithic entity, and I must treat them all with the same level of reverence. Letting go of any piece disrespects the family legacy.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Anne's struggle with her parents' baskets and inherited quilts, combined with her feeling that they "weigh on her," suggests an emotional burden tied to these items. The language she uses (“all this space,” "they all weigh on me") treats the items as a single unit.

**Reframing Response:** Gene highlights Anne's use of collective nouns, suggesting she's treating the items as a single entity rather than individual objects with varying levels of significance. He encourages her to evaluate each item separately and consider the value of each piece.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** This belief prevents Anne from decluttering and managing her possessions effectively.

**Hidden Belief:**  My possessions are part of my identity, and letting go of them diminishes me.

**Surfacing Trigger:** Sue's resistance to tackling "bigger piles" of clutter, along with the feeling of "oh no" when considering letting go, suggests a fear of loss deeper than just the objects themselves.

**Reframing Response:** Gene uses tapping to explore Sue's fear of letting go, highlighting the emotional connections to her belongings.  He emphasizes the all-or-nothing thinking that fuels the resistance and encourages her to be discerning on an individual level.  He encourages a practical step of *organizing* before making decisions about discarding.

**Behavioral or Emotional Impact:** This belief manifests as clutter and difficulty decluttering, leading to feelings of overwhelm and stagnation.
