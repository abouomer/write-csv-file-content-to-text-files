- "When I'm not well resourced, I'm told to take care of my resource state, I then have to make a choice about how I'm going to take care of my resource state. But I'm in a diminished resource state, so it's harder for me to make a good choice."

### ?? Synthesis Note:
The transcript reveals several key themes about context in transformation:

1. Resource state fundamentally shapes capacity for change and decision-making
2. The importance of pre-planning and having frameworks when resourced to use when depleted
3. Progress in transformation work shows up in how we relate to our own process
4. External contexts (like undermined credibility) directly impact internal resource state

A particularly promising direction seems to be developing more explicit teachings around "meta-commentary" - helping practitioners recognize and work with their own increasing sophistication in transformation work.

The distinction between having an experience and observing how we engage with that experience appears to be a key marker of development in transformation work.
