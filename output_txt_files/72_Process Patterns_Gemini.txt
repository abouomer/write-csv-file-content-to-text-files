**Process Pattern Name:**  
“Subconscious Reframe through Analogy and Gentle Questioning”

**Sequence Overview:**  
- Phase 1: Identify a limiting belief or emotional response.
- Phase 2: Gently question the belief's underlying assumptions, exploring alternative perspectives and definitions.
- Phase 3: Introduce an analogy that reframes the situation in a more manageable or understandable way.
- Phase 4: Guide the student to tap through the reframe, anchoring the new perspective. 
- Phase 5: Check in with the student's experience and iterate if necessary.

**Commentary:**  
Gene uses this pattern to help students uncover and shift limiting subconscious beliefs.  He begins by listening carefully to the student's description of their challenge, asking clarifying questions to pinpoint the core belief driving their emotional response. He then uses gentle, non-judgmental questions to challenge the rigidity of the belief, exploring alternative perspectives and definitions. A key element of Gene's process is the introduction of a simple, relatable analogy that reframes the situation. This helps the student understand the belief's impact and grasp a new way of relating to it. He then guides the student through tapping, using the reframe to target the underlying emotional charge and anchor the new perspective. Finally, he checks in with the student, allowing space for further exploration and adjustment if needed.

This pattern appears in multiple sessions (e.g., with Debbie, Bene, and Audrey). While the specific analogies and tapping phrases vary depending on the context, the underlying structure remains consistent. It effectively helps students gain insight into their subconscious patterns, reduce emotional reactivity, and open up new possibilities for action.
