Here are the key identity reframes I identified from the transcript:

**Identity Reframe 1:**
What was said: "There is the story of what we're describing has happened or is happening... and there is the story that is the meaning that we are giving to that."

**Contextual Spark:**
A practitioner was feeling paralyzed about working with a client, worried their inexperience would discredit tapping as a modality.

**Shifted Self-View:**
From seeing oneself as solely responsible for outcomes to recognizing oneself as part of a larger process of transformation where "planting seeds" is as valuable as "harvesting fruit."

**Permission Opened:**
Permission to engage imperfectly but meaningfully with clients, releasing the burden of being solely responsible for their healing journey.

**Strategic Deployment:**
- Onboarding for new practitioners
- Client breakthrough moments
- Program introductions

?? **Synthesized Identity Reframe:**
Gene's discussion of how transformational work often goes uncredited revealed an implicit identity shift for helpers - from needing recognition to accepting the inherent invisibility of profound impact. This wasn't explicitly stated but emerged through his storytelling about seatbelts and safety engineering.
