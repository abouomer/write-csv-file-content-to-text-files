Here's my analysis of Gene's hidden teaching systems from this transcript:

â€”
**Hidden System Observed:**  
"Safety-Acknowledgment-Possibility" (SAP) Framework for Resistance Work
"I recognize this feels unsafe ? I acknowledge why it makes sense ? I open possibility of new response"

**Patterned Across:**  
- Demonstrated in client work with Audrey around community safety fears
- Referenced in discussion about practitioner safety with Bene
- Appears in response to Debbie's family boundary issues

**Implied Design Logic:**  
1. Start with validation of current safety needs
2. Build bridge through acknowledging why current response made sense
3. Gently introduce possibility of proportional response
4. Use metaphor to make abstract concrete (e.g. "10 meter wall for 9cm of water")

**Why It Matters:**  
This system allows practitioners to work with resistance without triggering more resistance. It honors the protective function while creating space for change.

**System Type:**  
Resistance Handling / Safety Container Building

**Signature Potential:**  
High - Could be diagrammed as "The SAP Method" for working with safety-based resistance
