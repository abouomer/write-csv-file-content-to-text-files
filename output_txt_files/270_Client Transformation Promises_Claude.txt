Here are the key transformation insights I identified from Gene's facilitation in this office hours session:

—
**Transformation Statement:**  
"From second-guessing boundaries and pricing to recognizing 'This is what my time, expertise and experience are worth - they can say yes or no'"

**Type of Change:**  
Identity, Behavioral

**Transformation Arc:**  
From: Feeling obligated to discount/accommodate/rescue
To: Confidently stating worth and allowing others choice

**Why It Matters:**  
Shows how practitioners can shift from emotion-based pricing to value-based frameworks that honor their whole life context.

**Demonstrated In:**  
Multiple client interactions around pricing/boundaries (Debbie's discount request, Anne's art pricing, Maggie's pet sitting)

**Change Orientation:**  
Both Internal (identity shift) and External (behavior change)

**Statement Tone:**  
Teaching/Declaration

**Tags:**  
- Insight Density: 8/10
- Confidence: 9/10  
- Reusability: Hook/Teaching

?? Synthesized from multiple client interactions showing common pattern of:
1) Initial emotional response/obligation 
2) Recognition of full context/value
3) Permission to maintain boundaries
4) Framework for future decisions

Gene demonstrates how transformation isn't just about the immediate behavior change but developing sophisticated awareness of our responses and choices.
