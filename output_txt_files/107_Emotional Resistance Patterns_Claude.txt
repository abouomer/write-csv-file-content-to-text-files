Let me analyze the emotional resistance patterns from this transcript:

**Resistance Theme #1:**
"If I let go of physical items, I lose part of myself"

**Student Expression:**
"If I let it go, then...I'm not whole again" [Sue, discussing resistance to clearing items]

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Identity and worth are fused with possessions; letting go feels like self-diminishment.

**Energetic Signature:**
Frozen fear, collapse, paralysis when facing decisions about objects

**Facilitation Opportunity:**
- Frame organizing (vs discarding) as the first step
- Validate the emotional relationship with objects
- Break "all or nothing" thinking around keeping/discarding

**Strategic Use Case:**

**Resistance Theme #2:**
"If I'm not in total control, I'm not safe"

**Student Expression:**
"That I need to have control...that I'm not safe if things fall apart" [Linda]

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Safety and control are fused; any uncertainty triggers threat response

**Energetic Signature:**
Tension, constriction, rigidity when facing uncertainty

**Facilitation Opportunity:**
- Separate emotional safety from external control
- Build internal safety/resource awareness
- Practice "both/and" thinking vs binary control

**Strategic Use Case:**
