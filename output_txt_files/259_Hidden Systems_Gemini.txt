**Hidden System Observed:**  
“Identify the presenting problem ? Explore the emotions *about* the problem ? Unpack the meaning the person gives to the story ? Discover if that meaning is true (and if it serves them) ? Explore transformation *only* when the client is ready.”

**Patterned Across:**  
Across Q&A calls, coaching demos, likely client sessions (inferred)

**Implied Design Logic:**  
Gradual complexity layering; permission ? resistance ? possibility; safety ? stretch ? anchor; stained glass removal (clearing emotional blocks to reveal the core issue).

**Why It Matters:**  
Surfacing this system clarifies Gene’s client approach. It offers a replicable structure for other practitioners to navigate complex emotional issues without pushing clients too far, too fast.  It also reveals how Gene uses tapping even when tapping isn’t the *primary* tool.

**System Type:**  
Transformation Container / Teaching Arc / Resistance Handling

**Signature Potential:**  
High. This system encapsulates a core part of Gene’s transformational philosophy. It could be visualized as a flow chart or a layered diagram.

**Hidden System Observed:**  
“Acknowledge the client’s stated reality ?  Ask clarifying questions, often about definitions or potential consequences  ? Gently guide the client to reframe their perspective through embodied tapping and metaphor.”

**Patterned Across:**  
Q&A calls, coaching demos

**Implied Design Logic:**  
Gradual shift from the client’s initial frame to a more expansive one; uses embodied cognition (e.g., head tapping) and metaphorical language (e.g., “10-meter wall for 9 centimeters of water”) to facilitate reframing.

**Why It Matters:**  
This system highlights Gene’s skill in subtly guiding clients toward new perspectives without directly challenging their existing beliefs. It emphasizes the power of gentle inquiry, embodied practices, and metaphor in facilitating shifts.

**System Type:**
Resistance Handling / Teaching Arc / Sequencing

**Signature Potential:**
Moderate.  While not as groundbreaking as the first system, this pattern of questioning and reframing is central to Gene’s coaching style.

?? **Synthesized Hidden System Observed:**  
“Do I know *what* to do? ? Do I know *how* to do it? ? Do I have the *resources* to do it? ? Do I have the *capacity* to do it? ? Do I have the *want* to do it?”

**Patterned Across:**  
Q&A calls (mentioned as underlying his approach to problem-solving)

**Implied Design Logic:**  
Sequential prerequisite checklist for effective action; addresses both practical and emotional/motivational dimensions.

**Why It Matters:**  
This pre-SOD framework helps determine if a perceived block is emotional/psychological or due to a lack of knowledge, resources, or capacity. This distinction allows for more targeted interventions.

**System Type:**
Sequencing / Resistance Handling

**Signature Potential:**
Low-Moderate. While useful, this system might be too basic to be a standalone signature element, but it adds depth to Gene’s method.
