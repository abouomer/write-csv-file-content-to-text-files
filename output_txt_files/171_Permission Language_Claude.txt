Here are the key resistance patterns I identified from the transcript:

**Resistance Theme #1:**
"If I let go of physical objects, I lose part of myself/my history"

**Student Expression:**
"The things that I have gathered, I gathered for a reason... Some of them make me feel better, some of them solve a problem... I'm afraid to let go of something useful or valuable" - Sue

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Identity and security are tangled with physical possessions. Letting go feels like losing part of oneself or one's history/capability.

**Energetic Signature:**
Frozen, paralyzed resistance; emotional heaviness; overwhelm when facing decisions about objects

**Facilitation Opportunity:**
- Reframe from "all or nothing" to selective discernment
- Start with organizing vs. deciding
- Connect to identity/capability separate from objects

**Strategic Use Case:**

**Resistance Theme #2:**  
"I can't be of two minds - it means I'm failing at being decisive"

**Student Expression:**
"I don't feel it's safe and I don't feel I'm allowed to... be of two minds... We're taught to be decisive." - Linda

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Internal conflict between cultural programming demanding decisiveness and natural human complexity/ambivalence

**Energetic Signature:**
Collapse, emotional shutdown when facing complexity; need for control

**Facilitation Opportunity:**
- Normalize multiplicity of feelings
- Separate decisiveness in action from emotional complexity
- Build safety with uncertainty

**Strategic Use Case:**

?? Synthesized from multiple student interactions showing similar resistance to emotional complexity and need for clear answers.

Let me know if you would like me to analyze additional resistance patterns from the transcript.
