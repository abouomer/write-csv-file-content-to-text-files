**Metaphor:**
"Sometimes we're in a circumstance where we're picking between two crappy things, which means that when we pick between two crappy things, we end up with something that is far from perfect and as possibly painful."

**What It Illustrates:** The difficult choices we sometimes face, especially in family situations, where no option is ideal and all choices may lead to some degree of pain.

**Stickiness Factor:** The blunt and colloquial language ("crappy things") makes the metaphor relatable and memorable. The repetition emphasizes the limited and undesirable nature of the available options.

**What It Illustrates:**  The importance of preparing for challenging situations by simplifying decision-making processes in advance, especially when anticipating being in a depleted emotional or energetic state. Creating "menus" of options for self-care or action steps.

**Metaphor:** ?? Synthesized
"Revenge fantasies aren't necessarily always unhealthy…If I'm staying stuck...I get caught in an emotion that feels like it's an emotional *spin*. One is a *record player* where it's just playing the same song over and over...The other way...is a *ball of yarn*. And as the ball of yarn spins, it's getting smaller and smaller."


**What It Illustrates:** The difference between unproductive rumination (record player) and processing/releasing emotions (ball of yarn).  It normalizes experiencing difficult emotions like revenge but cautions against getting stuck in them.

**Stickiness Factor:**  The contrasting sensory experiences of a skipping record and a shrinking yarn ball provide concrete images for two different emotional processes.
