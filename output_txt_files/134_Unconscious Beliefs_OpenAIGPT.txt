Hidden Belief:  
“If I don't emotionally protect everyone, I'm failing — even if it hurts me.”

Surfacing Triggers:  
Danny said: “She always ends up hurting somebody’s feelings… and then I’m the protector of everybody.” Gene also noted Danny’s desire “to not be hurt” even though she’s entering a predictable minefield, linking the current pain to childhood wounding: “...some of the things… bring back terrible childhood experiences.”

Reframing Response:  
Gene gently named the impossibility of perfection: “You’re picking between two crappy things,” validating the pain instead of bypassing it. He guided a tapping sequence that reframes resource protection as a priority, not a compromise: “Make my resource state, and protecting my resource state… priorities,” and “I give myself permission… to have the courage to make hard decisions.”

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
Danny initially approached the situation with inner pressure to do it all and shield everyone. The belief was driving burnout, grief repression, and emotional Teflon idealism. After tapping, Danny reported “a calm” and said “Expectations lowered,” showing real-time re-regulation.

Hidden Belief:  
“If I consider my own limits, I’m being selfish or betraying the helper role.”

Surfacing Trigger:  
Debbie described her internal response to a request for discounted services triggered by a manipulative message: “There was a part of me that instantly jumped in thinking, how much can I discount my price?” Even though she felt manipulated and angry, the impulse to self-sacrifice arose reflexively.

Reframing Response:  
Gene affirmed Debbie’s internal strength — “I want to celebrate the fact you didn’t cave” — and distinguished between compassionate service and coerced obligation: “Being a helper is not just about helping others — there’s a cost involved.” The tapping sequence emphasized consent, boundaries, and self-valuing: “People I’m helping are not more valuable than me.”

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
The old belief had previously led to fast emotional compliance and undervaluation. This time, Debbie held her boundary, showing active rewiring — but the speed of the knee-jerk urge still distressed her. After tapping, she said it “still feels buzzy” but called the reframe a significant shift toward empowerment.

Hidden Belief:  
“If I'm struggling emotionally with a professional decision, it means I'm not competent or trustworthy.”

Surfacing Trigger:  
Ann delayed submitting art pricing forms despite weeks of lead time. She judged herself harshly: “This is not like me.” Even after resolving the logistics, she stayed emotionally fixated on the delay-decision loop, puzzled by her own hesitation.

Reframing Response:  
Gene reframed the struggle as part of growth: “This is the sophistication of someone further along in the transformational process… You’re engaging with your lived experience, not just reacting to it.” He normalized pricing confusion and art/commerce tension: “Pricing stuff is hard — until it's not.”

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
Ann felt shame and panic over “stalling,” despite ultimately succeeding. After the tapping, she reported returning to clarity and said, “I'm much less likely to stall out next time,” showing cognitive and emotional integration.

Hidden Belief:  
“If my service is simple or low-skill, it shouldn’t be fairly priced.”

Surfacing Trigger:  
Maggie questioned charging her standard petsitting rate for a single dog: “Why don’t I just throw out what I charge the other people? Why do I think I have to give them a discount?” She devalued her own contribution by saying, “Petsitting doesn’t take a lot of skill.”

Reframing Response:  
Gene deconstructed pricing components: “They’re hiring you for your experience, your expertise, and your time.” He positioned Maggie’s time as inherently valuable, regardless of the number of pets served. He differentiated “base disruption rate” versus complexity fees and gave analogies from speaking and print manufacturing to normalize rate tiers.

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
Maggie’s belief drove her to unintentionally subsidize client convenience at her own expense. After reframing, she began to define her own minimum-for-engagement, saying she’d “decide by tomorrow” and noted, “I suppose I’m just disturbing my life anyway.”

Hidden Belief:  
“Asking pricing questions or changing my mind makes me look dumb and unprofessional.”

Surfacing Trigger:  
Ann delayed reaching out to clarify logistics for art prints even though it was well within her rights. She said, “I could have asked those questions a month ago… I don’t know why.”

Reframing Response:  
Gene normalized the fear of “looking dumb” when combining money and art. He helped reframe the behavior as a result of context: “Money and art just scramble our brains.” He made it safe to embrace discomfort as part of the creative business cycle.

Behavioral or Emotional Impact:  
This internalized rule delayed choices, fed shame, and corrupted performance review. Once externalized, she soothed her self-talk. She also shifted perspective: “I only need the price to cover the print and commission.”
