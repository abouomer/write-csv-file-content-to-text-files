Here are the key metaphors and analogies from Gene's teaching in this transcript:

**Metaphor:** "There's two ways that I'm caught in an emotional spin. One is a record player where it's just playing the same song over and over and over again. The other way I can get caught in an emotional spin is a ball of yarn. And as the ball of yarn spins, it's getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller."

**What It Illustrates:**  
How we process and work through difficult emotions - either getting stuck in repetitive patterns (record player) or gradually working through and diminishing the emotional charge (unwinding yarn)

**Stickiness Factor:**
- Visual contrast between two types of circular motion
- One leads nowhere (record), one leads to resolution (yarn)
- Tactile familiarity of both objects
- Clear metaphor for transformation vs stagnation

**Transformation Type:** Process

**Delivery Context:** Spontaneous in response to client sharing about emotional processing

**Metaphor:** "It's kind of like the difference between my super old printer printing one page vs 30 pages - it has to wake up and transmit for that first page, but each successive page is easier once it's going."

**What It Illustrates:**
Base costs and incremental effort in service pricing and business operations

**Stickiness Factor:**
- Universal experience with printers
- Clear illustration of fixed vs variable costs
- Tangible example of economy of scale

**Transformation Type:** Problem solving/Business insight

**Delivery Context:** Used to help client understand pricing structure

The transcript contains other smaller analogies but these two stood out as the most vivid and conceptually useful teaching metaphors.
