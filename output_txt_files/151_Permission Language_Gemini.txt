**Resistance Theme:**  If I succeed (as a helper/artist/business person), I’ll lose something of myself / be overwhelmed with requests / be taken advantage of.

**Student Expression:**

*   Student 1: "So I just would love to tap in just to have a better awareness... comprehend without it hurting." (Wants to protect herself from emotional pain while caring for her mother.)
*   Student 3: "What really got me that for the first few moments, there was a part of me and instantly jumped on thinking, how much can I discount my price?" (Immediate impulse to comply with a discount request, despite feeling manipulated.)
*   Student 4: "I've had this option for a month and I was like waffling back and forth...I'm feeling bad that I am not the kind of person that puts stuff off like this." (Procrastination around pricing and submitting artwork for sale.)
*   Student 5: "Why don't I just throw out what I charge the other people? Like, why do I think I have to give them a discount?" (Struggling to charge appropriately for pet-sitting, undervaluing her time and service.)

**Psychological Mechanism:**

*   Fear of vulnerability and emotional pain.
*   Deep-seated belief in self-sacrifice as a necessary component of helping.
*   Fear of success leading to unwanted demands or exploitation.
*   Imposter syndrome and undervaluing one's skills/time.
*   People-pleasing tendencies and difficulty setting boundaries.

**Energetic Signature:**

*   Collapse (Student 1 – wanting to avoid pain).
*   Defensiveness (Student 3 – feeling manipulated).
*   Frozen fear (Student 4 – procrastination).
*   Resignation (Student 5 – undervaluing herself).


**Facilitation Opportunity:**

*   Tapping on the specific fears and limiting beliefs.
*   Reframing success as sustainable and fulfilling.
*   Narrative shift: exploring past experiences that reinforce these beliefs and rewriting them.
*   Group process: sharing experiences and normalizing the struggle.
