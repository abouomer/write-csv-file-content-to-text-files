Here are key identity reframes I identified from the transcript:

**Identity Reframe #1:**
What was said: "Why do you have to have compassion for them?" followed by exploring the difference between sympathy/empathy and emotional enmeshment.

**Contextual Spark:**
Student was struggling with feeling obligated to maintain compassion for toxic family members, seeing it as binary between being completely open or completely closed off.

**Shifted Self-View:**
From: Someone who must choose between being completely vulnerable or completely closed
To: Someone who can maintain healthy boundaries while still acknowledging others' humanity

**Permission Opened:**
Permission to create appropriate emotional distance without guilt or feeling like a "bad person"

**Strategic Deployment:**
- Facilitation Prompt
- Client Breakthrough Moment
- Curriculum Module on Boundaries

**Identity Reframe #2:**
?? Synthesized
What was said: Discussion of practitioner fears about "doing damage" by not being skilled enough, reframed through lens of planting seeds vs harvesting fruit

**Contextual Spark:** 
Practitioner anxiety about not being "good enough" and potentially causing harm

**Shifted Self-View:**
From: Someone who must be perfect to help
To: A contributor to an ongoing process of transformation

**Permission Opened:**
Permission to be an imperfect but caring guide rather than feeling responsible for complete transformation

**Strategic Deployment:**
