Based on this transcript, I can extract one clear framework around pricing professional services, though it was taught through examples rather than explicitly labeled. Here's my analysis:

â€”
**Framework Name:** 
"?? Synthesized: Three-Part Professional Service Pricing Model"

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
- Step 1: Price for Experience (Historical expertise & track record)
- Step 2: Price for Expertise (Current skills & capabilities)  
- Step 3: Price for Time (Including all associated costs & disruptions)
- Step 4: Add surcharges for additional complexity/demands

**Supporting Quote:**
"There are three things that they are hiring you for... They're hiring you for your experience. They're hiring you for your expertise and they're hiring you for your time."

**Commentary:**
While not explicitly labeled as a framework, Gene clearly outlines a repeatable approach to pricing professional services. He reinforces it through multiple examples (speaking engagements, pet sitting, printing services) showing how the core model applies across industries. The framework was synthesized from his explanations rather than presented as a formal teaching tool.

**Tags:**
- Insight Density Score: 8/10
- Confidence Score: 7/10 (synthesized but clearly articulated)
- Reusability Tier: Teaching
- Context: Professional Services, Pricing Strategy

Note: This framework emerged naturally through problem-solving rather than being presented as a formal model, but the components and logic are clear enough to be extracted as a repeatable teaching tool.
