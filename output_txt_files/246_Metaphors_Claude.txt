Here are the key metaphors I identified from Gene's teaching, formatted according to the requested structure:

—
**Metaphor:**
"It's like building a 10 meter wall for 9 centimeters of water. I definitely need to keep the water out, but I don't need 10 meters to keep it out."

**What It Illustrates:**  
The disproportionate emotional/protective responses we sometimes create versus the actual threat level present. Shows how we can acknowledge real needs for safety while recognizing when our protective mechanisms are excessive.

**Stickiness Factor:**
- Visual clarity - Easy to picture concrete image
- Clear size contrast creates immediate "aha" 
- Tangible representation of abstract concept (emotional overprotection)
- Built-in solution (right-sizing the wall)

**Transformation Type:**
Problem + Process - Helps identify overreaction while suggesting path to proportional response

**Delivery Context:**
Emerged spontaneously during client work around anxiety/hypervigilance

—
**Metaphor:**
"There's always two stories - the story of what happened, and the story of the meaning we give to what happened."

**What It Illustrates:**
How we layer interpretation and meaning-making on top of objective events, and how those meanings shape our emotional experience more than the events themselves.

**Stickiness Factor:**
- Simple binary framework
- Highlights key psychological insight
- Immediately applicable lens for self-reflection

**Transformation Type:**
Identity Shift - Helps separate events from interpretations
