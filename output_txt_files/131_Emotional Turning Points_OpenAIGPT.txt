Emotional Turning Point:  
Danny visibly shifts from tension to calm after tapping through the realization that managing her “resource state” is more compassionate and effective than trying to be emotionally invincible while caring for her mother with dementia.

Triggering Phrase or Move:  
“And I give myself permission to make my resource state, and protecting my resource state... as priorities.”

Emotional Shift:  
From overwhelmed protector role (“I have to hold everyone together”) to practical acceptance and empowered clarity. Her posture softens, breath deepens, and she starts to see tangible, manageable choices instead of emotional chaos.

Visible or Sensory Cue:  
Calm tone, deep exhale, notepad rustling as she writes down art therapy ideas.

Strategic Importance:  
This teaches grit and grace in family caregiving. “Taking care of the caretaker” isn’t just an idea—it becomes a felt sense. Naming resource state as a priority is a moving moment of internal permission and practical self-support.
