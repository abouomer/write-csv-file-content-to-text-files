Mistake or Misstep:  
“Jumping to process before allowing the nervous system to re-regulate — trying to figure everything out at once when you’re emotionally flooded.”

?? Synthesized from Gene’s work with Lisa and Eden

Example (Lisa): “I was thinking, oh my God, I'm losing my mind… I need to be checked into someplace.”  
Example (Gene’s guidance): “Don't process… Don't do anything other than just paying attention to what is going on and just be present.”

Example (Eden): “I notice how fearful my body feels right now… like, cortisol everywhere.”  
Example (Gene’s guidance): “Just tap and notice… The system is just responding. We’re not trying to shift it yet.”

Why It Fails:  
Trying to process from a dysregulated state overloads the system. Instead of creating clarity, it anchors panic. Energy stays tangled rather than opening new options — and the mind grasps for urgent meaning rather than rooted insight.

Gene’s Alternative:  
Begin with presence. Tap while simply noticing sensations, thoughts, and feelings — without judgment or forward pressure. Don’t interpret or make plans from a flooded state. He compares it to the shock of “jumping into freezing water.” First, normalize. Then re-engage.

Why It Matters:  
If we act from emotional chaos, we risk layering shame, judgment, or premature stories on top of the actual need. Grounded change requires grounded presence. Without nervous system safety, transformation attempts often backfire or collapse into exhaustion.

Mistake Type:  
Energetic / Psychological

Emotional Payoff:  
“Feels like trying,” “Signals I’m doing something,” “Prevents me from feeling too much at once”

Teaching Soundbite:  
“A dysregulated system can’t make wise plans.”

Mistake or Misstep:  
“Equating vigilance with safety — believing hyper-vigilance will prevent harm.”

Example (Laurel & Eden): Constantly imagining worst-case scenarios (falling, getting hit while driving) and feeling tense in response.

Why It Fails:  
Hyper-vigilance trains the system to expect threat. It increases tension, which ironically reduces capability and safety. Laurel realized: “All my anxiousness about falling is making me more tense and likely to fall.”

Gene’s Alternative:  
Tap while recognizing the vigilance was built from care — it wants safety. Then reframe: Tension doesn’t equal precision. Presence and flow help us navigate responsibly, not constantly bracing for disaster. “Being super tense while driving” makes us worse drivers.

Why It Matters:  
Without this shift, we create self-fulfilling prophecies of danger via the tension intended to prevent it. Real safety comes from relaxed, responsive attention — not obsessive control.

Mistake Type:  
Belief / Energetic

Emotional Payoff:  
“Feels like protection,” “Maintains illusion of control,” “Proves I care enough”

Teaching Soundbite:  
“Hyper vigilance isn’t safety — it’s sabotage disguised as care.”

Mistake or Misstep:  
“Believing grief invalidates gratitude — avoiding sadness out of fear it dishonors your survival or blessings.”

?? Synthesized from Eden’s processing of losing her home and belongings in the fire

Quotes:  
- “Part of me doesn’t feel allowed [to grieve]… because I’m alive and healthy.”  
- “If I engage in sadness, I’m not appreciating the fact that I’m alive.”

Why It Fails:  
Blocking grief fragments the self. It delays integration and puts pressure on our joy to feel unshakable. Gratitude becomes performative — a defense against discomfort — instead of genuine. Unprocessed grief distorts present safety and love.

Gene’s Alternative:  
You can hold both. “Just because I’m alive doesn’t mean I can’t engage with the loss.” Acknowledging sadness doesn’t deny your blessings — it honors your full humanity. Tap gently to allow space for grieving without measuring loyalty to the present moment.

Why It Matters:  
We don’t heal by suppressing complexity. We heal by allowing the truth of what was lost and the truth of what is good — at the same time. Denying one dulls both.

Mistake Type:  
Belief / Identity / Emotional Regulation

Emotional Payoff:  
“Avoids facing pain,” “Signals stoicism,” “Rehearses gratitude as moral shield”

Teaching Soundbite:  
“Grief doesn’t erase gratitude — it proves it.”

Mistake or Misstep:  
“Treating clutter or emotional attachment to belongings as a storage problem, rather than a grief or identity story.”

?? Synthesized from work with Brad, Anne, Sue

Why It Fails:  
Decluttering becomes impossible when items are emotionally tagged with legacy, loss, unfulfilled dreams, or survival patterns from family. Resistance isn’t laziness — it's grief, guilt, or ancestral programming. Attempting to organize without addressing that locks people in cycles of avoidance and overwhelm.

Example (Anne):  
“These baskets and quilts are from my family. They feel like a weight. There’s anger… but I’m not allowed to let them go.”  
Gene’s reframe: “You’re treating them as a monolith — not individual items. Let’s bring back discernment.”

Why It Matters:  
Each item symbolically carries roles, expectations, and meanings. If we don’t slow down to meet those meanings, we confuse emotional paralysis for practical indecision.

Gene’s Alternative:  
Step back from the all-or-nothing frame. Start with noticing. Organize without pressure to discard. Identify emotional vs. practical value — you're allowed to keep what matters and release what doesn't. No one-size rule for letting go.

Mistake Type:  
Relational / Identity / Emotional Legacy

Emotional Payoff:  
“Signals loyalty,” “Avoids triggering rejection or guilt,” “Secures self-worth through preservation”

Teaching Soundbite:  
“Sometimes decluttering is grief work.”

Mistake or Misstep:  
“Seeing inner conflict as failure — rejecting the state of being ‘of two minds’.”

?? Synthesized from Gene’s work with Linda

Linda: “Every time you say ‘of two minds,’ part of me relaxes… and part of me panics. It feels like confusion — like I have no direction.”

Why It Fails:  
When we live in rigid either/or frameworks, internal contradiction gets pathologized. We lose nuance. Decisiveness becomes performative, and wholeness becomes inaccessible. We mistake complexity for crisis, and rush to suppress one reality in favor of another.

Gene’s Alternative:  
You can be of two minds and still move forward. Tap to make space for emotional contradiction — “turn right, but still have emotions about turning left.” Being of two minds is awareness, not incompetence.

Why It Matters:  
Polarized minds create polarized lives. Allowing multidimensionality deepens truth and expands flexibility. Reconciling through force often fractures us farther from self-trust.

Mistake Type:  
Belief / Identity / Thought Patterning

Emotional Payoff:  
“Feels like control,” “Signals resolution,” “Avoids discomfort of ambiguity”

Teaching Soundbite:  
“Being of two minds isn’t indecision — it’s intelligence under construction.”
