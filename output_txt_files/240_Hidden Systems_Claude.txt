Here's my analysis of Gene's hidden teaching systems from this transcript:

**Hidden System Observed:** 
"Safety ? Story ? Reframe ? Integration"

**Patterned Across:**
Multiple client interactions in this session show this pattern:
- Lisa's environmental shock
- Laurel's fear of falling
- Eden's fire trauma
- Anne's family heirlooms
- Sue's decluttering resistance

**Implied Design Logic:**
1. Establish emotional safety through validation
2. Draw out the story/belief/fear
3. Introduce reframe or new perspective
4. Integration through body awareness/breathing

**Why It Matters:**
This structure allows Gene to:
- Meet clients where they are emotionally
- Avoid triggering additional resistance
- Create space for perspective shifts
- Ground new insights physically

**System Type:**
Transformation Container + Integration Arc

**Signature Potential:**
?? Synthesized - This could be developed into a formal "Safety-Story-Shift" framework for emotional processing

**Tags:**
- Insight Density Score: 8/10
- Confidence Score: 9/10 (appears consistently across multiple interactions)
- Reusability Tier: Teaching

Note: The pattern shows up with slight variations but maintains the core progression from safety through story to reframe and integration. Gene adapts the pacing and depth based on client needs while keeping this underlying structure.

Would you like me to analyze additional hidden systems from the transcript?
