Metaphor:  
“Families know either consciously or unconsciously…where all the soft spots are. Not even out of malice. Just…they have access to your blueprint.” [paraphrased]  

?? Synthesized — repetition & variant of “soft spots” and “they know where to press” seen in previous sessions  

What It Illustrates:  
Explains why deep emotional pain can get retriggered in family systems, especially during caretaking of an irrational or declining loved one. Anchors the inevitability of feeling hurt — no matter how evolved or self-aware the person may be — due to the uniquely intimate emotional coding family members hold.

Stickiness Factor:  
"Soft spots" evokes tactile, bodily vulnerability. The phrase “they have access to your blueprint” positions it as involuntary — there's a helplessness baked in. It clarifies: this isn’t about failing or lack of healing — it’s about inevitability of contact. Powerful reframe to reduce shame.  

Transformation Type:  
Emotional Truth / Problem Naming  

Delivery Context:  
Off-the-cuff wisdom offered at the start of a tapping sequence, in response to a student navigating anticipatory grief + family system triggers

Metaphor:  
“When we’re picking between two crappy things… we still end up with something that’s far from perfect — and possibly painful.”  

What It Illustrates:  
Helps name the emotional difficulty of constrained decision-making. Reduces idealized expectations around ‘clean choices’ and gives compassionate permission to accept emotional compromise when no option is great.

Stickiness Factor:  
Deadpan honesty + slight shock value. Unpretentious language (“two crappy things”) makes it emotionally disarming and highly human. Anchors the message that pain doesn’t mean you chose wrong.  

Transformation Type:  
Reframe / Identity Shift  

Delivery Context:  
Teaching preamble during tapping round — prepping mindset for emotionally complex family visit

Metaphor:  
“When I’m diminished, it’s harder to make a good choice to re-engage my resource state.”  
So I build a menu in advance: “Here are the four things I know will recharge me.”  
(It’s like lowering executive load so future-you doesn’t need to invent care from scratch.)  

What It Illustrates:  
Explains the cognitive trap that happens when exhausted: even self-care gets hard. Offers a structural solution — pre-decide support when clear-headed.

Stickiness Factor:  
‘Menu’ evokes immediate visual and tactile metaphors (restaurant, options, simplicity). The foresight loop (“make decisions when well-resourced to serve the future tired self”) is powerful. Feels doable.

Transformation Type:  
Process / Self-Support Framework  

Delivery Context:  
Formal mini-teaching during open office hour

Metaphor:  
“It’s not about managing one decision or one moment — it’s about the unfolding.”  

What It Illustrates:  
Frames overwhelm management not as performance perfection in a single moment, but capacity-sustaining over time. A wider diagnostic lens. Opens grace.

Stickiness Factor:  
“Unfolding” creates an image of ongoingness. Slows time. Undoes urgency. Softens black-or-white performance pressure.  

Transformation Type:  
Reframe / Process  

Delivery Context:  
Anchoring statement during tapping sequence, framed within caregiving

Metaphor:  
“It’s like an emotional spin — some spins are like phonographs playing the same thing again and again… but sometimes it’s like a ball of yarn — as you spin it, it gets smaller and smaller.”  

?? Synthesized — recurrent metaphor around stuckness + unraveling in Gene’s emotional processing toolkit  

What It Illustrates:  
Teaches how emotional stuckness isn’t always static — some loops are downward processing spirals that naturally reduce over time. A more graceful internal diagnostic tool.

Stickiness Factor:  
Highly visual — contrasting phonograph vs. yarn. Offers a richly layered metaphor that reframes looping as progress, in some cases.

Transformation Type:  
Reframe / Diagnostic  

Delivery Context:  
Used in one-on-one coaching layer within group call

Metaphor:  
“What I want to do when I’m in a diminished resource state is make every decision that I can simpler… when I’m well-resourced, that’s the time to think ahead.”  

What It Illustrates:  
Strategic temporal planning — how the strong version of self can design better supports for the future-not-okay self. Prevents burnout loops by understanding decision fatigue.

Stickiness Factor:  
Clear self-leverage loop. Treats “future you” as someone worthy of support. Simple but powerful predecision logic.

Transformation Type:  
Process  

Delivery Context:  
Explaining cognitive setup for caregiving situations or tough work tasks

Metaphor:  
“Often the person who shows up with the plan gets their way… the default option wins.”  

?? Synthesized — has appeared in various decision/power/agreement conversations before  

What It Illustrates:  
Reveals soft power in planning — when decision-makers are paralyzed, the clearest map wins. Empowers initiators to “set the default” thoughtfully.

Stickiness Factor:  
Extremely subtextual — explains unseen power dynamics in organizations or relationships. Elegant matching of practicality with psychological sway.

Transformation Type:  
Identity / Agency Pattern Recognition  

Delivery Context:  
Advising student stuck in corporate contract ambiguity

Metaphor:  
“Pricing is like print set-up: the customer is not just paying for paper; they’re paying for turning on the printer.”  

What It Illustrates:  
Frames baseline pricing as not just about delivery, but setup, prep, presence, and unseen overhead. Reminds practitioners that fulfillment = more than face time.

Stickiness Factor:  
Concrete analogy (printer power, labor, run-time). Undoes undercharging due to under-valuing all-in cost of emotional labor or showing up.

Transformation Type:  
Recalibration of value / financial reframe  

Delivery Context:  
Spontaneous support to practitioner underpricing pet sitting + emotional bandwidth

Metaphor:  
“You don’t have to extinguish all feeling to act with strength. Sometimes, there’s the pain — and you still hold your boundary.”  

What It Illustrates:  
Teaches emotional maturity as coexistence — actions can be aligned even when emotions protest. Creates an inner adult-child consciousness division.

Stickiness Factor:  
Emotionally validating. High-stakes compassion. Normalizes "both/and" states, dismantles binary perfection goal.

Transformation Type:  
Identity Shift / Emotional Truth  

Delivery Context:  
Supportive reframe after student maintained boundary while still triggered

Metaphor:  
“Ideally, the people in my life maintain my boundaries for me. Until then — I do.”  

?? Synthesized — core Gene frame around boundary logic  

What It Illustrates:  
Explains personal responsibility as a training ground — functional boundaries aren’t failures of the relationship, just stages of it

Stickiness Factor:  
Terse truth. Emotive. Structurally telescopic — it acknowledges evolution, not stuckness.

Transformation Type:  
Boundary Philosophy / Process  

Delivery Context:  
Accompanying shift work around charging full price despite discomfort
