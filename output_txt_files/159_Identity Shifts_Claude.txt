Here are the key identity reframes I identified from the transcript:

—
**Identity Reframe 1:**
> "I am allowed to be safe and not in control as long as I'm safe inside myself"

**Contextual Spark:**
Linda was struggling with the need to control everything to feel safe, expressing deep discomfort with being "of two minds" about situations.

**Shifted Self-View:**
From someone who needs external control to maintain safety ? Someone who can maintain internal safety regardless of external circumstances

**Permission Opened:**
- Permission to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Permission to act decisively while still having mixed feelings
- Permission to trust one's capacity to navigate uncertainty

**Strategic Deployment:**
- Onboarding: Initial mindset setting
- Facilitation: Helping clients navigate ambivalence
- Client Breakthrough: Shifting from external to internal safety anchors

**Identity Reframe 2:**
?? Synthesized
> "I can be thoughtful and deliberate with my fear without letting it control me"

**Contextual Spark:**
Laurel was experiencing intense anxiety about falling, which was actually making her more likely to fall due to tension.

**Shifted Self-View:**
From victim of fear ? Conscious navigator of fear

**Permission Opened:**
- Permission to acknowledge fear without being controlled by it
- Permission to take thoughtful action despite fear
- Permission to trust physical competence

**Strategic Deployment:**
