**Framework Name:** Unnamed Framework

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
- Step 1: Tune into the fear/issue.
- Step 2: Identify the physical sensations.
- Step 3: Ask the sensations what they are afraid of.
- Step 4: Ask the fear what proof it has.
- Step 5: Tap through the points while reframing the fear.
- Step 6: Check in with yourself and notice any shifts.
- Step 7: Repeat the process as needed with additional scenarios or layers of the issue.


**Supporting Quote:**  "So do this, tap the side of the hand. Just take an easy breath and I want you to imagine doing one of those things. Okay. And if you imagine that, what do you notice? Is there butterflies in the stomach? Is there total paralysis? Is there tightness in the chest? Is there a chattery brain that's given you a giant story? What do you notice?"

**Commentary:** Gene uses a consistent approach to tapping throughout this office hours session.  He guides participants to tune into their issue, identify bodily sensations, and question the fear underlying those sensations.  He then leads them through tapping points while offering reframes. This framework is observed repeatedly in the interactions with Laurel, Eden, Linda, and Sue.

**Framework Name:** ?? Synthesized: Course Tuning vs. Fine Tuning

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
- Step 1: Assess the scope of the issue.  Is it a broad, complex issue (like existential anxieties or grief over multiple losses), or is it a specific, isolated fear (like a fear of needles)?
- Step 2: If the issue is broad and complex (Course Tuning):  Start by noticing and exploring the issue generally, gathering information and identifying patterns without trying to force a solution. This might involve multiple tapping sessions focused on noticing and exploring different facets of the issue. Journaling can be helpful during this stage. 
- Step 3: If the issue is specific and isolated (Fine Tuning): Focus tapping sessions on the specific fear, using precise language and reframes to directly address the limiting beliefs.
- Step 4: After course tuning, transition to fine tuning. Once broader patterns and root causes are identified, use this information to inform more targeted tapping sessions on specific aspects of the issue.

**Supporting Quote:** "And so course tuning is me stepping back far enough back from the impressionistic painting to actually see the lily pads where fine tuning, as I'm so close to the impressionistic painting, all I see are the little bitty dots."

**Commentary:** This framework is synthesized from Gene's commentary during Anne's session and his reflections toward the end of the transcript. He contrasts "fine tuning" (dealing with specific instances) with "course tuning" (dealing with larger, global issues).  The step-by-step model is a reconstruction of his approach.

**Framework Name:** ?? Synthesized: Three-Pile Decluttering

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
- Step 1: Gather the items you want to declutter.
- Step 2: Create three piles:  "Keep," "Maybe," and "Get Rid Of."
- Step 3: Sort items into the piles based on your initial gut feeling.
- Step 4: Walk away from the piles for a period of time (15 minutes to several weeks).
- Step 5: Return to the "Maybe" pile and re-sort items into the "Keep" or "Get Rid Of" piles with fresh perspective.

**Supporting Quote:**  "I have three piles. I have keep, I have get rid of, and I have maybe…Oftentimes it happens for me as I have a keep, maybe, get rid of, and then I walk away for a period of time…And the maybe pile now that I reengage with the maybe pile, all of a sudden, because I have the clarity of distance, it becomes keep, maybe, get rid of."

**Commentary:** This is a practical decluttering method Gene mentions while talking with Anne. While not directly related to tapping, it utilizes the same principles of allowing space and revisiting decisions with fresh perspective.
