Here are the key resistance patterns I identified from the transcript:

**Resistance Theme:**
"I must rescue/help others even at my own expense"

**Student Expression:**
"There is this obligation that I should, I'm here to be of service and that I'm rejecting, I'm not helping struggling mother." (Student expresses guilt and obligation around pricing services)

**Psychological Mechanism:**
Deep conditioning around self-sacrifice and helper identity interfering with healthy business boundaries. The resistance emerges from conflict between professional value and ingrained helping impulse.

**Energetic Signature:**
Constriction and anxiety in belly area, accompanied by rationalization of why they "should" discount services. Self-diminishing energy.

This resistance pattern appeared consistently across different contexts (pet sitting, art sales, bodywork) suggesting it's a core challenge for helping professionals.
