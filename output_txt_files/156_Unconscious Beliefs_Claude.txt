Here are the key unconscious beliefs and reframes I identified from the transcript:

—
**Hidden Belief:**  
"If I let go of physical objects, I'm losing part of myself/my identity"

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Sue: "If I let it go, then yeah, I'm not tall again" when discussing resistance to clearing clutter

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene helped reframe the all-or-nothing thinking about possessions, emphasizing that being discerning about individual items is possible without wholesale rejection of everything.

**Behavioral Impact:**  
Pattern of paralysis and resistance when facing larger decluttering tasks, only able to handle small areas

**Strategic Reuse:**

**Hidden Belief:** ?? Synthesized
"I must control everything to be safe"

**Surfacing Trigger:**  
Linda's revelation about discomfort with being "of two minds" and needing decisive control

**Reframing Response:**  
Gene reframed that safety comes from internal comfort/knowing oneself rather than external control

**Behavioral Impact:**  
Rigid decision-making, difficulty holding multiple perspectives or emotions simultaneously

**Strategic Reuse:**
