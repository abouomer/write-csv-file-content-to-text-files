Here are the key unconscious beliefs I identified from the transcript, formatted as requested:

**Hidden Belief:**
"If I'm not constantly hypervigilant after experiencing aggression/threat, I'm being reckless and unsafe"

**Surfacing Trigger:**
Student describes excessive vigilance after a single aggressive incident in January, stating "after any community meeting, I can't sleep for three nights" and needing to ensure others are always present.

**Reframing Response:**
Gene used the metaphor of "building a 10 meter wall for 9 centimeters of water" to illustrate the disproportionate response. He emphasized: "Not being this afraid and not being this on guard does not mean I am going to be reckless."

**Behavioral Impact:**
- Insomnia after community meetings
- Hypervigilance in community spaces
- Requiring others present as safety buffers
- Emotional escalation (using uncharacteristic language)

**Strategic Reuse:**
Teaching about disproportionate safety responses / Tapping Script for trauma-based hypervigilance / Coaching Tool for scaling appropriate responses

?? **Synthesized Belief:**
"I must maintain extreme vigilance or I'll be vulnerable to harm again" - synthesized from the pattern of described behaviors and emotional responses around safety/threat.
