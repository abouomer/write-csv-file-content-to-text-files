**Framework Name:**  The 5 Gates of Problem Solving

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
- Gate 1: Do I know *what* to do?
- Gate 2: Do I know *how* to do it?
- Gate 3: Do I have the *resources* to do it?
- Gate 4: Do I have the *capacity* to do it?
- Gate 5: Do I have the *want* to do it?

**Supporting Quote:**
"So when I'm trying to solve a problem, there are prerequisites, and the prerequisites are, do I know what to do? Do I know how to do it? Do I have the resources to do it? Do I have the capacity to do it, and do I have the want to to do it?"

**Commentary:**
Gene explicitly lays out this framework as a series of prerequisite "gates" one must pass through when attempting to solve a problem. He emphasizes that sometimes what we perceive as emotional resistance is actually a lack of clarity or resources related to one of these gates. Addressing these practical elements can often clear the perceived emotional block.

**Framework Name:** Unnamed Framework (Two Stories)

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
- Step 1: The Story of What Happened/Is Happening (Facts)
- Step 2: The Story of the Meaning We Give It (Interpretation)
- Step 3: Explore the Emotions arising from the Meaning Story
- Step 4: Investigate if the Meaning Story is True.
- Step 5: Aim for Proportionate, Well-Informed Emotional Response.


**Supporting Quote:**
"There's always two stories. Okay. There is the story of what we describing has happened or is happening. Mm-hmm. And there is the story that is the meaning that we are giving to that."

**Commentary:**
Gene outlines a clear progression of how we relate to events: the objective event itself, the meaning we assign to it, and the resulting emotions.  He suggests exploring the validity of our "meaning story" to achieve a more balanced emotional response. This wasn't a named teaching asset, but its step-wise nature makes it a solid framework.

**Framework Name:**  Unnamed Framework (Helping Roles)

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
- Step 1: Planting Seeds
- Step 2: Pulling Weeds
- Step 3: Harvesting Fruit


**Supporting Quote:**
"Sometimes I am planting seeds, sometimes I am pulling weeds, sometimes I am harvesting fruit... all three of those are valuable in transformation."

**Commentary:**
While not strictly sequential, Gene presents these as distinct roles a helper can play in someone's transformation.  He notes the importance of each stage, even the less glamorous ones.  The agricultural metaphor provides a vivid image for the different types of support we can offer.

**Framework Name:** ?? Synthesized (Renegotiating Relationships)

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**  
- Step 1: Identify Porous Boundary
- Step 2: Choose a New, Small Response (e.g., "I'm sorry, that really sucks.")
- Step 3: Consistently Apply New Response When Boundary is Crossed
- Step 4: Observe Gradual Renegotiation of Relationship Dynamics

**Commentary:**  
This is synthesized from Gene's example of setting a boundary with someone who treated him like Google.  He didn't present it as a generalized framework, but the underlying process of incremental change through consistent small actions can be extracted and applied to other boundary-setting scenarios. It's worth noting this requires commitment and time ("months").
