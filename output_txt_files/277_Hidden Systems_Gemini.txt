**Hidden System Observed:**  
"Gene consistently uses a three-part flow in responding to student questions: 1. **Framing/Reframing:** Acknowledging the challenge and offering a new perspective. 2. **Tapping:** Guiding the student through a tapping sequence addressing the core emotional blocks. 3. **Integration/Action:**  Helping the student translate the insights gained through tapping into practical actions and mindset shifts."

**Patterned Across:**  
Across Q&A calls, office hours

**Implied Design Logic:**  
Safety ? Stretch ? Anchor; Head ? Heart ? Hands;  Problem ? Process ? Solution

**Why It Matters:**  
This structure provides a container for transformation. The framing/reframing creates safety and allows for cognitive shifts, tapping addresses the emotional charge, and the integration phase empowers students to implement change. Surfacing this system can help Gene explicitly teach it to students, making them more effective at self-coaching.  It also allows others to replicate his approach more easily.

**System Type (optional):**  
[Teaching Arc / Transformation Container]

**Signature Potential (optional):**  
High. This could be a core element of Gene’s signature teaching methodology. Diagramming it visually would amplify its impact.
