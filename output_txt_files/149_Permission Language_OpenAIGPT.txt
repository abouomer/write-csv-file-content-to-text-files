Resistance Theme: I have to rescue people — even if it costs me.  
Student Expression: “Somehow there is obligation… that I’m rejecting... I’m not helping a struggling mother. I believe when I see her tomorrow... she will have nails and everything done... that requires money.” Tone: internal conflict under pressure, rising emotion, protective loyalty.  
Psychological Mechanism: Identity entanglement between worthiness and utility. Subconscious payoff: perceived moral superiority, and conflict avoidance. Shadow belief: “If I don’t help, I’m selfish or bad.”  
Energetic Signature: Surging urgency; buzzy nervousness; boundary collapse under moral pressure; grief and anger flickering under service posture.  
Facilitation Opportunity: Narrative shift — from identity as rescuer to identity as a steward of capacity with clear boundaries. Multistage tapping: first for seduction of martyrdom (“being a good person”), then for internal permission to delineate self from client.

Resistance Theme: If I charge too much, people will stop liking or respecting me.  
Student Expression: “She’s asking for a discount… part of me instantly jumped into ‘How much can I discount?’” + “I’ve discounted for her in the past, and now it’s expected.”  
Psychological Mechanism: Fawning response to relational authority and guilt-based self-worth. Fear of social punishment through withdrawal, subtle misunderstanding of boundaries as betrayal.  
Energetic Signature: Obedience impulse cloaked in helpfulness; freeze-fawn oscillation; anger under shame; confusion coded as generosity.  
Facilitation Opportunity: Tap on triangulation and inherited identity as appeaser. Reframe: holding price is holding respect for the work — and for the client’s agency. Teaching moment from Gene emphasizes “pricing as stewardship” and “boundaries are allowed to cost things.”

Resistance Theme: I should be able to do hard things without it hurting.  
Student Expression: “I just want to go do the checklist… but I can’t fix her… I want it not to hurt.” + “She says hurtful things. And it brings up terrible childhood memories.”  
Psychological Mechanism: Repetition compulsion combined with stoic perfectionism. Idealized self-image of “perfect daughter/protector,” prone to chronic emotional burnout. Fear that vulnerability = weakness.  
Energetic Signature: Bravado paired with buried grief; controlled sorrow; protector mode overburdened into collapse.  
Facilitation Opportunity: Narrative disruption + reparenting tap: “I can be hurt and still show up. Grace isn’t pain-free, it’s pain-aware.” Brilliant Gene-led reframes already live: resourcing before strategy.

Resistance Theme: If I mess up the pricing, I’ll be embarrassed or exposed.  
Student Expression: “I charged way more than I ever have before… I only just realized I copied someone else’s price without meaning to…” + “I delayed for weeks. I’m not the sort to delay.”  
Psychological Mechanism: Perfectionism laced with fear of public misjudgment. Inner critic overlays shame on experimentation. Identity stakes high: “Real artists don’t improvise or guess.”  
Energetic Signature: Embarrassment masked as logic; freeze masquerading as deliberation; meta-shame for slow action.  
Facilitation Opportunity: Tap on “I am allowed to learn in public.” Encourage internal checkpoint for resource state over image maintenance. Normalize art+pricing as inherently subjective. Reframe via Gene: Pricing doesn’t signal worth.

Resistance Theme: If I lower the bar, I’ll be safe.  
Student Expression: “I’m stalling because I don’t want to get it wrong.” + “But I don’t even care if someone buys it… and I do want it to sell… kind of.” (ambivalence)  
Psychological Mechanism: Preemptive deflation as a defense — “If I don’t ask too much, I won’t be disappointed or judged.” Pre-traumatic shame response from visibility + unmet hopes.  
Energetic Signature: Dimming oneself; split will (desire + fear); protective apathy; whispered ambition.  
Facilitation Opportunity: Gentle self-validation tap + future-self visualization: What if someone wanted to pay even more? Edge expansion: “I can grow without collapse.”

Resistance Theme: If I make it about my needs, I’ll lose their respect and the job.  
Student Expression: “They’re asking me to pet sit — but I still need to go home to care for my cat. Why don’t I just throw out the same price I charged the others?”  
Psychological Mechanism: Internal class-linked credibility conflict — over-functioning to avoid being “too expensive.” Helper’s guilt repackaged as logistical problem (“Maybe if I didn’t have this need...”).  
Energetic Signature: Defensive reasoning; guilt-drenched justification; subtle resentment hidden inside care.  
Facilitation Opportunity: Tap sequence on “My needs deserve to be in the price.” Use Gene’s metaphor: “Every print job has a start-up fee — even if it’s just one image.” Great for freelancers shifting toward sustainable business models.
