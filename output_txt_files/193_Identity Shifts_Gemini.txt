**Identity Reframe:**
> _“Why do you have to have compassion for 'em?”_

**Contextual Spark:**
Student 1 is struggling with maintaining compassion for a relative who is a compulsive liar. They feel exhausted and drained by the constant lies and gaslighting, yet feel obligated to be compassionate, fearing they will become hardened and less human without it.  They express feeling like either a completely open wound or completely shut down, struggling to find a middle ground.

**Shifted Self-View:**
Student 1 shifts from feeling obligated to have compassion to questioning the necessity of it in this situation. This opens up the possibility of setting boundaries and prioritizing their own well-being without feeling like they are failing as a practitioner or a human being.

**Permission Opened:** 
This shift gives Student 1 permission to explore alternative responses to their relative's behavior, beyond the extremes of complete openness or complete shutdown. It creates space for them to prioritize their own well-being and to explore what healthy boundaries might look like in this relationship.

**Strategic Deployment:**
[Client Breakthrough Moment / Facilitation Prompt] - This question can be used when clients feel obligated to have compassion for someone at their own expense.

**Identity Reframe:**
> _“You’ve been acting like someone who needs permission.”_  (?? Synthesized)
> _"What if you’re not becoming a practitioner — what if you already are one?”_ (?? Synthesized)

**Contextual Spark:**
Student 3 expresses hesitation about working with a potential client, questioning their own capacity and fearing they might do a "bad job" and make tapping seem ineffective.  They are caught in a cycle of self-doubt and are avoiding taking action.

**Shifted Self-View:**
Gene’s reframing prompts a shift in Student 3 from feeling like an inadequate, aspiring practitioner to someone who already *is* a practitioner. The shift is further reinforced by challenging the student's assumption of control over the client's outcome, implying they are acting as if they need permission to practice.

**Permission Opened:**
This empowers Student 3 to move forward with the sessions, trusting their existing skills and knowledge.  It also frees them from the burden of feeling solely responsible for the client's success.

**Strategic Deployment:**
[Onboarding Emails / Facilitation Prompt / Client Breakthrough Moment] – This reframe is powerful for new practitioners struggling with imposter syndrome or for experienced practitioners facing self-doubt in new situations.
